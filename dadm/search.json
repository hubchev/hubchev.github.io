For example, in 1992 I could name all soccer players in Germany’s first division including how many goals they scored. Later, in 2003 I joined the introductory statistics course of Daniel Rösch. I learned among others that probabilities often play a role when analyzing data. I continued my data science journey with Harry Haupt’s Introductory Econometrics course, where I studied the infamous Jeffrey M. Wooldridge (2002) textbook. It got me hooked and so I took all the courses Rolf Tschernig offered at his chair of Econometrics, where I became a tutor at the University of Regensburg and a research assistant of Joachim Möller. Despite everything we did had to do with how to make sense out of data, we never actually used the term data science which is also absent in the more 850 pages long textbook by Wooldridge (2002). The book also remains silent about machine learning or artificial intelligence. These terms became popular only after I graduated. The Harvard Business Review article by Davenport & Patil (2012) who claimed that data scientist is “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century” may have boosted the popularity.\n\nWooldridge, J. M. (2002). Introductory econometrics: A modern approach. In Delhi: Cengage Learnng (2nd ed.). South-Western.\n\nDavenport, T. H., & Patil, D. (2012). Data scientist: The sexiest job of the 21st century. Harvard Business Review, 90(5), 70–76.\nThe term “data scientist” has become remarkably popular, and many people are eager to adopt this title. Although I am a professor of data science, my professional identity is more like that of an applied, empirically-oriented international economist. My hesitation to adopt the title “data scientist” also stems from the deep respect I have developed through my interactions with econometricians and statisticians. Considering their in-depth expertise, I feel like a passionate amateur.\nUltimately, I poke around in data to find something interesting. Much like my ten-year-old younger self who analyzed soccer statistics to gain a deeper understanding of the sport. The only thing that has changed since then is that I know more promising methods and can efficiently use tools for data processing and data analysis.",

Unfortunately, neither you nor I know what situations you will end up in in business where you can take advantage of using data to make good decisions. There are countless ways to contribute by understanding “data analysis for decision-making”. Therefore, I will try to provide knowledge that is as general as possible. This way, I increase the likelihood that at least some parts of the lecture will be important for your future.\nSince access to the internet is virtually constant and instantaneous these days, it’s hard to add value by memorizing something. In seconds, we get answers to almost any sort of question using tools like Google and ChatGPT. Therefore, I don’t see much added value to your education by teaching you facts and schemes to solve problems. Instead, I try to build up your skills and your data literacy that will help you ask the right questions, search for the right information, and use and analyze data in a meaningful way.\nPerhaps you know the saying\nI would like to add something here.

    "text": "1.2 What is data analysis for decision-making\nFor successful communication, intersubjectivity is essential. Once we agree on a clear definition of the words used in the title of this lecture, we can identify the things that we need to know, where to find them efficiently, how to evaluate and use the knowledge.\nData refers to all types of recordable information – facts about something or someone. Data analysis involves the thorough examination of this information with a specific goal in mind. Decision-making is defined as the process of reaching a decision. The word decision comes from the Latin verb decidere, which has various meanings, including\n\nmake explicit,\nput an end to,\nbring to conclusion,\nsettle/decide/agree (on),\ndie,\nend up,\nfail,\nfall in ruin,\nfall/drop/hang/flow down/off/over,\nsink/drop,\ncut/notch/carve to delineate,\ndetach,\ncut off/out/down,\nfell.\n\nLet’s agree on the following definition:\n\nFitzgerald (2002, p. 8): “A decision is the point at which a choice is made between alternative—and usually competing—options. As such, it may be seen as a stepping-off point—the moment at which a commitment is made to one course of action to the exclusion of others.”\n\nFitzgerald, S. P. (2002). Decision making. Capstone Publishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.1 Pass the course\nTo pass this course, you will be required to give a 10-minute presentation and produce a 3-5 page handout. Your performance will be measured by the quality of your work in relation to the time available. The value of the presentation lies not only in the content, but also in the impact it has on your audience – your classmates and your professor. Your goal is to add some value with your work.\nDiscuss:\n\nWhat do you need to know to do well in this course?\nWhere can you find the information you need to be successful?\nWhat tools will help you find, store and use information efficiently?\nHow can you verify the accuracy of the information you find?\nHow can you analyze information to gain valuable insights?\nHow can you communicate these insights effectively?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.2 Information is omnipresent\nFacts are abundant and easily accessible, so education should not just focus on providing information. Instead, skills should be developed to deal effectively with the wealth of facts available. This includes mastering statistical methods and avoiding common pitfalls when working with data.\nTo find the appropriate statistical method and interpret the data correctly, you should have some knowledge about the type of data and variables that you look at. Use ChatGPT to inform yourself about the following points that are defined in the module description:\nData literacy competencies\n\nTypes of data: Cross-section, panel, time-series, georeferenced, …\nTypes of variables: Continuous, count, ordinal, categorial, …\n\nMake a short presentation about it. At best, include definitions and examples to the different types of information.\nMoreover, what tools would you pick to make the presentation? Discuss the pros and cons of the options available.",

    "title": "2  From anecdote to insight",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Anecdotes are great. They are true stories—often intriguing, relatable, and easy to understand. They provide vivid examples that make abstract ideas more concrete and memorable. Whether it’s a personal experience or a captivating story about a successful business leader, anecdotes resonate because they tap into our natural affinity for storytelling. Their simplicity and emotional impact can make them powerful teaching tools.\nAnd importantly, anecdotes are hard to contradict. Take, for example, the argument that smoking can’t be that harmful because your 88-year-old uncle has smoked his entire life and he is still in good health. It’s a tough claim to refute, as it’s a real-life example. However, the problem lies in extrapolating a single, isolated case to draw broader conclusions, which can be misleading.\nHowever, while anecdotes can be persuasive, their strength is also their weakness. They represent isolated instances, and while it’s hard to deny the truth of an individual story, the danger lies in overgeneralizing from it. Anecdotes lack the rigorous analysis and breadth of evidence necessary to draw reliable conclusions. They don’t account for the full complexity of most situations, especially in business, where decisions are influenced by many interconnected factors.\nIn business, relying too heavily on anecdotes can lead to misguided conclusions. For example, a company might base its strategy on the success story of a famous entrepreneur without considering the countless failed ventures that didn’t make the headlines. This is known as survivorship bias, where the successes are visible, but the failures are hidden.\nThe challenge, then, is to take anecdotes and go beyond them. Instead of drawing direct conclusions, use them as starting points for deeper investigation. They can provide valuable hypotheses but need to be supported by data, rigorous analysis, and an understanding of the underlying principles at play. Anecdotes can inspire curiosity and point us in interesting directions, but they should be tested against a larger body of evidence to ensure that the insights we draw are reliable and applicable in a broader context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.1 Survivorship bias\nRead “How Successful Leaders Think” by Roger Martin (2007) and the chapter “Identification” of “Quantitative Methods” by Huber (2024).\nHere is a summary of Martin (2007) taken from the Harvard Business Review Store:\n\nIn search of lessons to apply in our own careers, we often try to emulate what effective leaders do. Roger Martin says this focus is misplaced, because moves that work in one context may make little sense in another. A more productive, though more difficult, approach is to look at how such leaders think. After extensive interviews with more than 50 of them, the author discovered that most are integrative thinkers–that is, they can hold in their heads two opposing ideas at once and then come up with a new idea that contains elements of each but is superior to both. Martin argues that this process of consideration and synthesis (rather than superior strategy or faultless execution) is the hallmark of exceptional businesses and the people who run them. To support his point, he examines how integrative thinkers approach the four stages of decision making to craft superior solutions. First, when determining which features of a problem are salient, they go beyond those that are obviously relevant. Second, they consider multidirectional and nonlinear relationships, not just linear ones. Third, they see the whole problem and how the parts fit together. Fourth, they creatively resolve the tensions between opposing ideas and generate new alternatives. According to the author, integrative thinking is an ability everyone can hone. He points to several examples of business leaders who have done so, such as Bob Young, co-founder and former CEO of Red Hat, the dominant distributor of Linux open-source software. Young recognized from the beginning that he didn’t have to choose between the two prevailing software business models. Inspired by both, he forged an innovative third way, creating a service offering for corporate customers that placed Red Hat on a path to tremendous success.\n\n\nDiscuss the concepts introduced by Martin (2007) critically:\n\n\nDoes he provide evidence for his ideas to work?\nIs there a proof that his suggestions can yield success?\nIs there some evidence about whether his ideas are superior to alternative causes of action?\nWhat can we learn from the article?\nDoes his argumentation fulfill highest academic standards?\nWhat is his identification strategy with respect to the causes of effects and the effects of causes?\nMartin (2007, p. 81) speculates:\n\n\n“At some point, integrative thinking will no longer be just a tacit skill (cultivated knowingly or not) in the heads of a select few.”\n\n\nIf teachers in business schools would have followed his ideas of integrative thinkers being more successful, almost 20 years later, this should be the dominant way to think as a business leader. Is that the case? And if so, can you still gain some competitive advantage by thinking that way?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Distribution of bullet holes in returned aircraft\n\n\n\nSource: Martin Grandjean (vector), McGeddon (picture), Cameron Moll (concept), CC BY-SA 4.0, Link\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1 visualizes the distribution of bullet holes in aircraft that returned from combat in World War II. Imagine you are an aircraft engineer. What does this picture teach you?\nInform yourself about the concept of survivorship bias explained in Wikipedia (2024).\nIn Martin (2007), the author provides an example of a successful company to support his management ideas. Discuss whether this article relates to survivorship bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin, R. (2007). How successful leaders think. Harvard Business Review, 85(6), 71–81. https://hbr.org/2007/06/how-successful-leaders-think\n\nHuber, S. (2024). Quantitative methods: Lecture notes. https://hubchev.github.io/qm/\nDrawing insights from anecdotes is challenging, especially in business, for several reasons:\n\nLimited sample size: Anecdotes are usually individual cases that do not reflect the full extent of a situation. In business, decisions often require data from large, diverse populations to ensure reliability. Relying on a single story or experience can lead to conclusions that are not universally valid.\nBias and subjectivity: Anecdotes are often influenced by personal perspectives, emotions or particular circumstances. Moreover, anecdotes often highlight success stories while ignoring failures. This is an example for the so-called Survivorship Bias.\nLack of context and the inability to generalize: Anecdotes often lack the broader context necessary to understand the underlying factors of a situation. Business problems tend to be complex and influenced by numerous variables such as market trends, consumer behavior and external economic conditions. Many of these variables change significantly over time. Without this context, an anecdote can oversimplify the problem and lead to incorrect decisions. Anecdotes are usually specific to a particular time, place or set of circumstances. They may not apply to different markets, industries or economic environments, which limits their usefulness for general decision-making. For example, learning only from the tremendous success of figures like Steve Jobs while ignoring the countless people who failed is like learning how to live a long life by talking to a single 90-year-old person. If that person happens to be obese and a heavy smoker, it doesn’t mean those behaviors contributed to their longevity.\nLack of data rigor: Anecdotes lack the rigor and precision of data-driven analysis where the empirical model that allows to identify causality and to measure the effect of causes is formally described.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nTo make informed business decisions, it is critical to base insights on systematic data analysis rather than anecdotal evidence, as anecdotes are too narrow, subjective and unreliable to guide complex business strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2 Systematic analysis as an alternative to anecdotal analysis\n\nWhat defines a systematic analysis?\nWhen can we say that we have ‘found evidence’?\nWhen can we claim to have identified a causal effect?\nWhen can we trust the size of an effect that we have measured?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Distribution of bullet holes in returned aircraft",

    "title": "3  Epistemic errors",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Many things can go wrong when analysing data. Various issues can lead to misleading interpretations, whether due to data not measuring what it is intended to, human misinterpretation, or an overreliance on probabilistic reasoning. The following examples illustrate these pitfalls and are drawn from the insightful book by Jones (2020), which I highly recommend for further reading.\nEpistemic errors, that are mistakes related to knowledge, understanding, or the acquisition of information, arise from cognitive biases, misunderstandings, and incorrect assumptions about the nature of data and the reality it represents. Recognizing and addressing these errors is crucial for accurate data analysis and effective decision-making.\nWhen researchers analyse data they should be aware of the fact that data can represent reality but do not necessarily do so. For example, a survey on customer satisfaction that only includes responses from a self-selected group of highly engaged customers may not accurately reflect the overall customer base, see the box Hite Report. To avoid this pitfall, it is essential to ensure that your data collection methods are representative and unbiased, and to validate your data against external benchmarks or additional data sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHite Report\n\n\n\nIn 1976, when the The Hite Report (see Hite (1976) and Figure 3.1) was published it instantly became a best seller. Hite used an individualistic research method. Thousands of responses from anonymous questionnaires were used as a framework to develop a discourse on human responses to gender and sexuality. The following comic concludes the main results.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The Hite (1976) Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Comic on the Hite Report\n\n\n\nSource: Picture is taken from www.theparisreview.org.\n\n\n\nThe picture of womens’ sexuality in Hite (1976) was probably a bit biased as the sample can hardly be considered to be a random and unbiased one:\n\nLess than 5% of all questionnaires which were sent out were filled out and returned (response bias).\nThe questions were only sent out to women’s organizations (an opportunity sample).\n\nThus, the results were based on a sample of women who were highly motivated to answer survey’s questions, for whatever reason.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Data-Reality Gap\n\n\n\nThe difference between the data we collect and the reality it is supposed to represent.\n\n\nAnother common epistemic error involves the influence of human biases during data collection and interpretation. Known as the all too human data error, this occurs when personal biases or inaccuracies affect the data. An example would be a researcher’s personal bias influencing the design of a study or the interpretation of its results. To mitigate this, implement rigorous protocols for data collection and analysis, and consider using double-blind studies and peer reviews to minimize bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Too Human Data\n\n\n\nErrors introduced by human biases or inaccuracies during data collection and interpretation.\n\n\nInconsistent ratings can also lead to epistemic errors. This happens when there is variability in data collection methods, resulting in inconsistent or unreliable data. For example, different evaluators might rate the same product using different criteria or standards. To avoid this issue, standardize data collection processes and provide training for all individuals involved in data collection to ensure consistency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInconsistent Ratings\n\n\n\nVariability in data collection methods that leads to inconsistent or unreliable data.\n\n\nThe black swan pitfall refers to the failure to account for rare, high-impact events that fall outside regular expectations. Financial models that did not predict the 2008 financial crisis due to the unexpected nature of the events that led to it are an example of this error. To prevent such pitfalls, consider a wide range of possible outcomes in your models and incorporate stress testing to understand the impact of rare events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Black Swan Pitfall\n\n\n\nThe failure to account for rare, high-impact events that fall outside the realm of regular expectations.\n\n\nFalsifiability and the God pitfall involve the tendency to accept hypotheses that cannot be tested or disproven. This error might occur when assuming that a correlation between two variables implies causation without the ability to test alternative explanations. To avoid this, ensure that your hypotheses are testable and that you actively seek out potential falsifications. Use control groups and randomized experiments to validate causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalsifiability and the God Pitfall\n\n\n\nThe tendency to accept hypotheses that cannot be tested or disproven.\n\n\nTo avoid epistemic errors, critically assess your assumptions, methodologies, and interpretations. Engage in critical thinking by regularly questioning your assumptions and seeking alternative explanations for your findings. Employ methodological rigor by using standardized and validated methods for data collection and analysis. Engage with peers to review and critique your work, providing a fresh perspective and identifying potential biases. Finally, stay updated with the latest research and best practices in your field to avoid outdated or incorrect methodologies.\nUnderstanding and addressing epistemic errors can significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of your data analyses, leading to better decision-making and more trustworthy insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.1  \n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Bananas in various stages of ripeness\n\n\n\nSource: Jones (2020, p. 33)\n\n\n\n\nRate the ripeness level of the bananas pictured by Figure 3.3. Compare your assessment to that of a colleague and discuss any differences in your ratings. What might account for the variance in perception of the bananas’ ripeness between you and your colleague?\nSpecify how you rated the second and the last bananas on the ripeness scale?\nUpon reevaluation, it appears that the second and the last bananas are identical in ripeness. How would you justify your initial decision now? This scenario underscores an important lesson for interpreting polls and surveys: it illustrates how subjective assessments can lead to variance in results. It highlights the necessity of ensuring clarity and consistency in the criteria used for evaluations to minimize subjective discrepancies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJones, B. (2020).

Specifically, work through the resources listed in the box below. Although Git may appear complex, it is generally not too challenging for most users. Many people use Git primarily to track their work and to host and share files conveniently with just a handful of commands. While Git is a robust system with many capabilities, you don’t need to memorize all the commands (see Figure 5.3). In fact, you typically use only a few basic ones as shown in Table 5.1.\nIn the upcoming sections, I will demonstrate some use cases both in the terminal Section 5.3 and within RStudio Section 5.4.

Essentially, it focuses on the three Git commands illustrated in Figure 5.4.\n\n5.3.1 Configuring Git\nBefore you start using Git, you need to configure your Git environment. Set your username and email address with these commands:\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\"\n\n\n5.3.2 Initializing a Repository\nTo create a new Git repository, use the git init command in the directory you want to version control:\ncd /path/to/a/directory\nmkdir my_project\ncd my_project\ngit init\nIn case you are not familiar with using the terminal please consider Table 5.2 where I introduce the most basic commands that we use. For example, with cd you can change your directory and with mkdir you create a new directory. If you are not familiar with the file system of your computer please read the section Navigating the file system of Huber (2024). With git init you initialize the directory to be a git repository. This will create a hidden folder “.git” in which Git keeps track of all your changes.\n\nHuber, S. (2024). How to use R for data science: Lecture notes. https://hubchev.github.io/ds/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost common bash commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Most common bash commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBash Command (macOS/Linux)\nWindows Command Prompt Equivalent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npwd\ncd\nPrints the current directory’s path.\n\n\nls\ndir\nLists all files and directories in the current directory.\n\n\ncd\ncd\nChanges the directory.\n\n\nmkdir\nmkdir\nCreates a new directory.\n\n\nrmdir\nrmdir\nRemoves an empty directory.\n\n\ntouch\ncopy nul\nCreates a new empty file or updates an existing file’s timestamp.\n\n\nrm\ndel or erase\nRemoves files. rmdir /s is used for directories.\n\n\ncp\ncopy\nCopies files or directories.\n\n\nmv\nmove\nMoves or renames files or directories.\n\n\necho\necho\nDisplays a line of text/string.\n\n\ncat\ntype\nConcatenates and displays the content of files.\n\n\ngrep\nfind or findstr\nSearches for patterns in files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Staging Changes\nTo track changes in your repository, you need to stage them using the git add command. To stage a single file:\ngit add filename.txt\nTo stage all changes in the directory:\ngit add .\n\n\n5.3.4 Committing Changes\nAfter staging, you can commit it to the repository. A commit records changes to the repository and must include a message describing what changed:\ngit commit -m \"A message\"\n\n\n5.3.5 Pushing Changes\nTo share your commits with others or store them in a remote repository (GitHub), use git push. A prerequisite here is that you need to be connected to a remote repo. Therefore, you must add a remote repository by copying the URL of the GitHub repo as shown in Figure 5.5. Then you can add the remote repository and push it to the repo with these lines of code:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git\ngit push -u origin main\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Copy the https URL of your repo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.6 Undo changes\nWith git reset and git revert you can go back in time and undo specific changes, respectively. For example, with\ngit log\ngit reset --hard &lt;commit_id_hash&gt;\nyou can view the commit history and find the hash identifier of the commit to move the HEAD pointer to that commit. This effectively removes all commits after commit you choose from the current branch’s history. Be cautious when using git reset –hard as it discards all changes made after the specified commit. Make sure you have backups or are certain you want to discard these changes before proceeding.\nWith\ngit revert &lt;commit_id_hash&gt;\nyou revert the changes introduced by that commit only. It will create a new commit that undoes the changes made in commit chosen while keeping the other commits that may have followed the chosen commit intact. It’s a safer approach compared to git reset --hard, as it preserves the commit history and allows you to selectively undo changes without affecting the rest of the commits.",

    "text": "5.4 Using Git from RStudio\nIntegrating Git with RStudio enhances your project management by utilizing version control directly within the IDE. Here’s how you can set up and use Git in RStudio using R code.\n\n5.4.1 Set up Git in RStudio\nFirst, ensure the usethis package is installed and loaded:\n\nif (!require(pacman)) install.packages(\"pacman\")\npacman::p_load(usethis)\n\nConfigure your Git settings in RStudio:\n\nuse_git_config(user.name = \"Your Name\", user.email = \"Your@email.com\")\n\nYou can change the configuration of your user name and email using the edit_git_config() function.\nStart a new project in RStudio, which will also initialize a Git repository:\n\ncreate_project(\"~/Music/\")\nuse_git()\n\nAfter restarting RStudio, you will notice a Git tab in the top right panel, indicating that Git is now active for your project.\n\n\n5.4.2 Connecting RStudio Projects with GitHub repositories\nTo connect your RStudio project with GitHub, you need a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub. If you haven’t one already, you can use the create_github_token() function from usethis package, and store the PAT securely with gitcreds_set from the gitcreds package:\n\nif (!require(pacman)) install.packages(\"pacman\")\npacman::p_load(usethis gitcreds)\ncreate_github_token()\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nNow, the procedure depends on whether the project has bin initialized on your local machine and you want to create a repo on GitHub, or the repo already exists on GitHub and you want to connect that remote repo with your local PC. Both ways are described below.\n\n5.4.2.1 Project exists on RStudio first\nAfter initializing Git in your project, use the use_github() function from usethis to create a new GitHub repository and connect it directly:\n\nuse_github()\n\nThis creates a repo on your GitHub account.\n\n\n5.4.2.2 Project exists on GitHub first\nAlternatively, suppose you have created a repository on GitHub first, then start a new project in RStudio using the version control option, specifying your new repository’s URL. Just click File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control and then link the GitHub repo by putting the URL into the respective box of the menu. See Figure 5.5 how to get the URL of a repo.",

If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch\n\n\n\nthis video where I do all the following steps in real time. It takes about 15 minutes.\n\n\n1. Create an account on GitHub\nIt is for free and should just take some minutes.\n2. Install Git\nHere is a tutorial on how to set up Git.\n3. Fork this repository\nClick on the fork button (see Figure 5.6) on the top of this page: https://github.com/hubchev/make_a_pull_request. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Fork the repo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Clone the forked repository\nGo to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon, see Figure 5.5.\nThen, open a terminal and run the following git command:\ngit clone \"url you just copied\"\nwhere “url you just copied” (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.\nFor example:\ngit clone https://github.com/this-is-you/make_a_pull_request.git\nwhere this-is-you is your GitHub username. Here you’re copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.\n5. Create a branch\nChange to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):\ncd make_a_pull_request\nNow create a branch using the git switch command:\ngit switch -c your-new-branch-name\nFor example:\ngit switch -c add-Stephan-Huber\n6. Make changes.\nNow open theI_am_a_data_scientist.md file in a text editor. (You find this file in the repository.) Add your name, your GitHub account and the project you are working on. You can put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.\nIf you go to the project directory and execute the command git status, you’ll see there are changes.\n7. Add changes (staging). Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add command:\ngit add .\n8. Commit changes. Now commit those changes using the git commit command:\ngit commit -m \"Add your-name to the list\"\nreplacing your-name with your name.\n9. Use Git Bash. Open Git Bash and set your email and your nickname on GitHub:\ngit config --global user.name \"FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME\"\ngit config --global user.email \"MY_NAME@example.com\"\n10. Push changes to GitHub.\nPush your changes using the command git push:\ngit push -u origin your-new-branch-name\nreplacing your-new-branch-name with the name of the branch you created earlier.\nIf you get any errors while pushing that refers to authentication failed something, go to GitHub’s tutorial on generating and configuring an SSH key to your account. Alternatively, you can watch this YouTube tutorial\n11. Submit your changes for review on GitHub.\nIf you go to your repository on GitHub, you’ll see a Compare & pull request button. Click on that button.\nNow submit the pull request.\nSoon I’ll be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.\nCongrats! You just completed the standard fork -&gt; clone -&gt; edit -&gt; pull request workflow that you’ll often encounter as a contributor!\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: The FINAL.doc problem\nFigure 5.2: GitHub is big\nFigure 5.3: Memorizing six git commands\nFigure 5.4: Three git commands you really need\nFigure 5.5: Copy the https URL of your repo\nFigure 5.6: Fork the repo",

    "section": "",
    "text": "6.1.1 No-code vs. code-based writing applications\nStudents often use Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, or LibreOffice to write scientific texts. These word processing programs operate on the “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) principle, displaying the document layout as you type. While this principle and its corresponding applications are widespread and may seem indispensable to many, this is far from true. Alternatives such as LaTeX, Markdown, R Markdown, and Quarto offer significant advantages. Many professional scientists and publishers prefer these alternatives for good reason. A large number of doctoral theses and scientific papers are authored using LaTeX, and nearly all publishers and editors work with code-based solutions that do not follow the WYSIWYG principle.\nWith code-based alternatives, layout specifications are either placed at the beginning of the text or embedded within the main text itself. The final document is only visible after converting (also called compiling or rendering) it into a format such as PDF. This may initially seem unusual and less intuitive than a WYSIWYG interface, but the most intuitive solution is not necessarily the best or simplest. My experience supervising numerous student papers has shown that the intuitive features of MS Word and Pages often become time-consuming over the medium to long term and fail to adequately support users in avoiding errors when writing scientific work. Students who choose code-based applications tend to experience less frustration and greater success—at least, this has been true for the papers I have supervised.\nCode-based applications allow writers to focus on the actual writing process, as formatting and adherence to citation rules are largely automated by the software. The necessary initial investment in learning a tool like Quarto quickly pays off, resulting in noticeable improvements in the quality of scientific texts.\nIn the following subsections, I will first outline typical usage of WYSIWYG applications, then discuss the advantages of code-based text creation using Quarto as an example, and finally explain how to successfully write texts using Quarto.\n\n\n6.1.2 Typical (mis)usage of WYSIWYG applications\nThe use of traditional word processing software like Microsoft Word or Apple Pages for writing academic papers is pervasive among students. While these programs are user-friendly for everyday writing projects, they create a significant additional workload to meet the demands of academic work.\nOne of the first problems is integrating literature. Correct formatting according to various citation guidelines is often counter-intuitive, and errors occur easily. This is particularly true if the citation and bibliography functions provided by the software are not used or are used incorrectly. Instead of utilizing external citation managers and investing time to learn how to use them, many students manually create citations and bibliographies, which typically leads to numerous small and sometimes larger errors that could be avoided.\nAnother weak point in student work is adherence to specific formatting requirements. Academic institutions and journals often require strict adherence to formatting guidelines, including the design of title pages, headers and footers, page margins, and heading hierarchies. Although Word and Pages offer templates and styles, they must be individually adapted for each document and often modified due to minor text changes. Making a format adjustment can become a major effort.\nThe inclusion of empirical results such as statistical data and graphics presents an additional hurdle. With Word and Pages, the process is frequently manual: research data must be exported from statistical software, saved as images, and then embedded in the document. If the data changes, this time-consuming process must be repeated, significantly increasing the workload and risk of errors.\n\n\n6.1.3 Advantages of Quarto for writing text\nWriting academic texts using traditional tools such as MS Word or Pages can be time-consuming and error-prone for students. In the following section, I introduce Quarto (or R Markdown), a modern alternative that offers several advantages:\n\nVersatile output formats: Quarto makes it effortless to generate different output formats. The same text can be rendered as a website (HTML), manuscript (PDF, DOCX), book (EPUB, PDF), or slides (PDF). This flexibility allows you to focus more on the content than the format.\nSimplified formatting changes: Specific templates can be used in Quarto, simplifying the process of making formatting changes.\nSeamless literature integration: Quarto handles citation rules compliance and integrates seamlessly with citation management systems, enabling researchers to manage literature references and bibliographies more efficiently and consistently than in Word.\nEasy cross-referencing: Creating cross-references to sections, tables, and figures is straightforward.\nDirect data analysis and output generation: Data analysis and output generation occur directly within Quarto, ensuring that displayed graphics and tables are always up-to-date. This eliminates the need for manual post-processing and guarantees the reproducibility of results.\nEmbedded data visualizations: Researchers can embed data visualizations directly in the text without manual intermediate steps.\nEfficient collaboration with version control: Version control systems like Git make collaboration on academic documents more manageable. Changes can be tracked and integrated without relying on complex and conflict-prone comparison tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading recommendation\n\n\n\nFor those interested, I recommend the online course Introduction to Reproducible Publications with RStudio, which explains explicitly how to work in an empirically reproducible manner. A somewhat more compact introduction is offered by Bauer & Landesvatter (2023), and the authoritative work on the subject is by Gandrud (2020).\n\n\n\nGandrud, C. (2020).

In case you want to use another directory you can do so by changing the working directory with setwd(). However, that is not persistent in R Markdown and only works for the current code chunk. After the code chunk has been evaluated, the working directory will be restored to the directory where the Rmd file is placed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.2 Start Markdown and R Markdown\n\nYou can learn Markdown (not R Markdown!) in 10 minutes. Just go to https://www.markdowntutorial.com and work throught the interactive lessons.\nNow create your first R Markdown file in 3 minutes by doing the following:\n\nclick in RStudio on File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown\nclick OK\nlook for a button entitled Knit and click it\nsave your file (it will be saved with .Rmd file extension)\n\nPlay around with the file. For example, change the output format can you create a word file or a presentation. Play around with the code chunks. Add a picture that you find somewhere online.\nSet your working directory to the folder where you have saved your first Rmd-file. Can you come up with a way to generate different output format with just one function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.3 R Markdown cite literature\n\nCreate a new R Markdown file (File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown), save the file in an empty folder, and knit it.\n\n\n\nMake a new script with File &gt; New File &gt; R Script.\nGo to https://scholar.google.de/ and search for osrmtime.\nClick on “cite” and “BibTeX”. Copy and paste everything that you see into your script and save the script as lit.bib. R Studio will ask you if you confirm the file type change. Click yes. Your lit.bib file should look like this:\n\n@article{huber2016calculate,\n  title={Calculate travel time and distance with OpenStreetMap \n    data using the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)},\n  author={Huber, Stephan and Rust, Christoph},\n  journal={The Stata Journal},\n  volume={16},\n  number={2},\n  pages={416--423},\n  year={2016},\n  publisher={SAGE Publications Sage CA: Los Angeles, CA}\n}\n\nAdd the text “bibliography: references.bib” to your YAML header of your R Markdown file so that it looks somehow like that:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\nauthor: \"Stephan Huber\"\ndate: \"`r Sys.Date()`\"\noutput: html_document\nbibliography: lit.bib\n---\n\nNow you can cite the OSRMTIME paper with @huber2016calculate somewhere in the text of your R Markdown file.\nKnit the R Markdown file and you should see the paper cited and a reference list at the end of the html report.\nYou can manipulate the citation style you can specify a CSL (Citation Style Language) file in the YAML header. For example the APA style can be chosen with:\n\ncsl: \"https://www.zotero.org/styles/apa.csl\"\nMany more citation styles can be found on github.com/citation-style-language and on the Zotero Style Repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.4 Preparing APA journal articles (papaja)\nThere is an easy way to write a manuscript that follows all the APA rules using the package papaja written by two psychologists from Cologne. Please read their manual and consider their repository on GitHub.\nNow, install and load the package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"papaja\")\nlibrary(\"papaja\")\n\nThen, click “File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown” and choose the “APA-style manuscript” from the section “from template”. Knit the R markdown template and you will have a template for a APA manuscript.\nApart from the obvious adjustments, I recommend to make at least two general adjustments: Change classoption to “doc” and linenumbers to “no”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.5 R Markdown template\nPlease follow the instructions below to access the file “23-09_ds-project-desc.Rmd” from my GitHub account:\n\nDownload the file from my GitHub account by clicking on the link provided here.\nSave the file in your working directory.\nUse the knit function to run the file, but be aware that it may not work properly at first. If you encounter any issues, troubleshooting may be required. Don`t worry, error messages will usually provide guidance to help you resolve the issue. Please note that the YAML header is sensitive to spacing, so be careful when setting it up to avoid breaking the code.\nIn the project template, I have used BibTeX to cite literature. This method is excellent for automating tedious tasks such as citing papers and generating reference lists based on citation styles, saving time and reducing the likelihood of citation errors. The literature cited is in a separate file, which can be found on one of my GitHub repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Example of an R Markdown file\nFigure 6.2: R Markdown Cheatsheet from Posit\nFigure 6.3: Xie et al.

If not, download and install it from Quarto’s official website.\nStep W2: Create a website\nFollow the tutorial that you find here.\nStep W3: Copy the _site directory\nAfter you have rendered your website a directory “_site” appears in the project folder that contains your website. Copy all files of that directory to a directory where you want to save your website. Let’s say my_website.\nIn the terminal you can do this with\nmkdir /home/sthu/my_website/\ncp -r /home/sthu/quarto_website/_site/* /home/sthu/my_website/",

    "text": "7.2 Hosting the website on GitHub\nR Studio and Quarto offers you various ways to publish the website. I explain you a way that worked out well for me.\nStep G1: Create a GitHub account\nGitHub will host your thesis website and manage version control for your thesis project. If you don’t already have a GitHub account, you’ll need to create one: Sign up at GitHub.\nStep G2: Create a repository\nCreate a repository. Name the repo with your username followed by github.io. You find a tutorial here.\nStep G3: Obtain a personal access token\nA personal access token (PAT) is required to authenticate with GitHub from Quarto and RStudio. This token allows you to push changes to your repository securely. Follow the instructions to create a personal access token on GitHub. Alternatively, you can do the following in R:\n\nif (!require(pacman)) install.packages(\"pacman\")\npacman::p_load(usethis)\ncreate_github_token() \n\nMake sure to note down your token and keep it secure. You’ll use this token in RStudio and Quarto to authenticate your GitHub operations.\nStep G4: Install and Learn Git\nSee Section 5.2.\nStep G5: Upload the website to GitHub\nUse the Terminal of R Studio. Go to the directory with your website that you have copied in Step W3. Then initiate a git repository on the command line, connect it to the repository created in Steph G2 on GitHub and finally push it:\ncd /home/sthu/my_website/\necho \"# test\" &gt;&gt; README.md\ngit init\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/test-hsf/test.git\ngit push -u origin main\nAlternatively, you can clone a repository, make some changes, and then push those changes back to GitHub. Here are the Bash commands to accomplish this:\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git\n\n# Make changes, here adding a new file as an example\necho \"Some content for the new file\" &gt; newfile.txt\n\n# Add the new file to the repository\ngit add newfile.txt\n\n# Commit the changes\ngit commit -m \"Add new file\"\n\n# Push the changes back to GitHub\ngit push origin main",

For guidance on creating a standalone HTML file, refer to this resource. Additionally, I will explain how Quarto and GitHub work in the lecture.\nThe design and the layout of the presentation slides are your choice. However, please avoid trying to impress with elaborate layouts or extraneous details. This is an academic presentation, and distracting decorations are inappropriate. Your primary focus should be on effectively communicating information, facts, and insights to the reader. Feel free to include any elements that support this goal. In the presentation, tables and figures don’t need to be numbered.\nThe layout of the handout should be like it is a convention in academic writing as simple as possible. In the handout, all tables and figures should be numbered and the text should refer to them. In case of doubts, please apply the rules and conventions explained in APA (2020). You can use the QMD file of this guide as a template. We will discuss that in the class in greater detail. Moreover, for your handout, please adhere to the following formatting rules:\n\nUse the documentclass set to article,\non A4 paper,\nset the font size to 11pt, and\nspecify the margins with 30mm at the top and bottom and 20mm on the left and right.\n\nThese guidelines will help maintain a consistent and organized appearance throughout your document.\nIn any academic work, all sources must be cited.
