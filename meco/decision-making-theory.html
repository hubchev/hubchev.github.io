<p>After successful completion of the module, students are able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distinguish different theories of decision making.</li>
<li>Calculate the optimal decision under certainty, uncertainty, and under risk.</li>
<li>Describe and use various criteria of decision making.</li>
<li>Simplify complex decision making situations and use formal approaches of decision making to guide the decision making behavior of managers.</li>
<li>Avoid common mistakes when applying heuristics in decision making.</li>
<li>Use investment calculus to make good financial decisions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Decision making under certainty means that we assume that we are certain about the future state of nature, i.e., we have complete information about the alternative actions and their consequences. Making decisions under certainty may seem like a trivial exercise. However, many problems are so complex that sophisticated mathematical techniques are sometimes needed to find the best solution.</p>

<p>Suppose you have to decide between four different restaurants where you want to go out to eat (<span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_4\)</span>).

The corresponding payoff table is given below. High numbers represent good quality. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> refer to competing alternatives where to eat for dinner, and <span class="math inline">\(k_i\)</span> are certain characteristics of the respective restaurant, and the numbers given in the table indicate the output.</p>

<p>Some alternative can be excluded because they are <strong>dominated</strong> by other alternatives. In the scheme above you can see that alternative 2 is always superior to alternative 3, i.e., alternative 3 is dominated by alternative 2.

<h3>Weighting<a href="decision-making-theory.html#weighting" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As the objectives <span class="math inline">\(k_j\)</span> of the scheme above do not represent different states of nature but represent characteristics and its corresponding utility (whatever that number may mean in particular) of one particular characteristics if we choose a respective alternative. For example, think of that you can choose one out of four restaurants, <span class="math inline">\(a_1,\dots,a_4\)</span>, in order to eat a five-course menu, <span class="math inline">\(k_1,\dots,k_5\)</span>, and the outcome represents your utility of each course, <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, for each restaurant, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. We already know from the domination principle that restaurant <span class="math inline">\(a_3\)</span> is a bad choice.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a preference for the first three courses. Specifically, suppose that your preference scheme is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
g_1 : g_2 : g_3 : g_4 : g_5 = 3 : 4 : 3 : 1 : 1

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Linear programming<a href="decision-making-theory.html#linear-programming" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Linear Programming is a common technique for decision making under certainty. It allows to express a desired benefit (such as profit) as a mathematical function of several variables. The solution is the set of values for the independent variables (decision variables) that serves to maximize the benefit or to minimize the negative outcome under consideration of certain limits, a.k.a. constraints. The method usually follows a four step procedure:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>state the problem;</li>
<li>state the decision variables;</li>
<li>set up an objective function;</li>
<li>clarify the constraints.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Consider a factory producing two products, product X and product Y. The problem is this: If
you can realize $10.00 profit per unit of product X and $14.00 per unit of product Y, what is the production level of x units of product X and y units of product Y that maximizes the profit P each day? Your production, and therefore your profit, is subject to resource limitations, or constraints. Assume in this example that you employ five workers—three machinists and two assemblers—and that each works only 40 hours a week.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Product X requires three hours of machining and one hour of assembly per unit.</li>
<li>Product Y requires two hours of machining and two hours of assembly per unit.</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>State the problem:</em> How many of product X and product Y to produce to maximize profit?</li>
<li><em>Decision variables:</em> Suppose x denotes the number of product X to produce per day and y denotes number of product Y to produce per day</li>
<li><em>Objective function:</em> Maximize <span class="math display">\[P = 10x + 14y\]</span></li>
<li><em>Constraints:</em></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>machine time=120h</li>
<li>assembling time=80h</li>
<li>hours needed for production of one good:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>machine time:</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\rightarrow 3h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow 2h\)</span></p>
<p><em>assembling time:</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\rightarrow 1h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow 2h\)</span></p>
<p>Thus, we get:
<span class="math display">\[3x + 2y \leq 120 \quad \Leftrightarrow y\leq 60-\frac{3}{2}x \quad \text{(hours of machining time)}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[x + 2y \leq 80 \quad \Leftrightarrow y \leq 40-\frac{1}{2}x \quad \text{(hours of assembly time)}\]</span>
Since there are only two products, these limitations can be shown on a two-dimensional graph (<a href="#fig:lpe2">3.1</a>). Since all relationships are linear, the solution to our problem will fall at one of the corners.</p>
<div class="float">
<img src="fig/lpe2.jpg" style="width:75.0%" alt=" Linear program example: constraints and solution" />

</div>
<p>To draw the isoprofit function in a plot with the good <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> on the y-axis and good <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on the x-axis, we can re-arrange the objective function to get <span class="math display">\[y=\frac{1}{14}P-\frac{10}{14}x\]</span>
To illustrate the function let us consider some arbitrarily chosen levels of profit in :</p>
<ul>
<li>$350 by selling 35 units of X or 25 units of Y</li>
<li>$700 by selling 70 units of X or 50 units of Y</li>
<li>$620 by selling 62 units of X or 44.3 units of Y.</li>

</div>
<p>To find the solution, begin at some feasible solution (satisfying the given constraints) such as <span class="math inline">\((x,y) = (0,0)\)</span>, and proceed in the direction of <em>steepest ascent</em> of the profit function (in this case, by increasing production of Y at $14.00 profit per unit) until some constraint is reached. Since assembly hours are limited to 80, no more than 80/2, or 40, units of Y can be made, earning <span class="math inline">\(40 \cdot \$14.00\)</span>, or $560 profit. Then proceed along the steepest allowable ascent from there (along the assembly constraint line) until another constraint (machining hours) is reached. At that point, (x,y) = (20,30) and profit P = (20 * +10.00) + (30 * +14.00), or $620. Since there is no remaining edge along which profit increases, this is the optimum solution.</p>

<p>The decision-making process of consumers and producers lies at the core of microeconomic research and is of significant importance for managers. I will not go into detail here, but I will show some examples of how to come to a decision when certain information is given.</p>
<p>Before we come to the Lagrangian multplier method, let me define what (micro)economist mean when they speak of firms and consumers.</p>
<p>A <em>firm</em> is a productive unit. In particular, it is an organization that produces goods and services, called the <em>output</em>. To do so, it uses inputs called <em>factors of production</em>: labor, capital, land, skills, etc. The relationship between the inputs and the output is the production function. The goal of the firm is to achieve whatever goal its owner(s) decide to achieve. Usually, it is (and in Germany, for example, it has to be the case by law) to generate profits, i.e., total revenue minus total cost for the level of production.
Determining the optimal level of production for a firm is a multifaceted decision that encompasses various strategic aspects and is heavily influenced by the market situation of firms. This includes factors such as market power, demand function, production function, cost function, and revenue function.</p>
<p>A consumer is an individual that purchases goods or services to satisfy their needs. They make decisions regarding what to buy, how much to buy in order to maximize their utility. Microeconomists study consumer behavior and factors that influence it, such as prices, income, preferences, and market conditions, to understand the choices consumers make and their impact on markets and the overall economy.</p>
<p>For a deeper understanding of the microeconomic preliminaries related to this topic, please read section <a href="appendix.html#micro-pre">6.1</a> of the appendix.</p>

<div class="figcaption"> Contours of the function and the constraint in red</div>
</div>
<p>The Lagrange multiplier method, named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange,
is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to constraints.
The red curve in Figure <a href="#fig:lagr2">3.4</a> represents the constraint <span class="math inline">\(g(x, y) = c\)</span>,
while the blue curves depict contours of <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span>.
The point where the red constraint tangentially intersects a blue contour
represents the maximum of <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> along the constraint, as <span class="math inline">\(d1 &gt; d2\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a detailed visual explanation of the method, you can watch Dr. Trefor Bazett’s
YouTube video on <a href="https://youtu.be/8mjcnxGMwFo">Lagrange Multipliers | Geometric Meaning &amp; Full Example</a>, see figure <a href="#fig:lagrange-yt">3.5</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The Lagrange multiplier method, named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange,
is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems with constraints.
It allows us to find the local maxima and minima of a function subject to certain conditions.
The method involves four key steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Formulate the Problem</strong></p>
<p>Define the problem you want to solve in mathematical terms.
This includes specifying the objective function to be maximized or minimized and the constraints that need to be satisfied.</p>
<p>The problem that we want to solve can be written in the following way,
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{ll}
    \max _{x, y} &amp; F(x, y) \\
    \text{ s.t. } &amp; g(x, y)=0
\end{array}
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(F(x, y)\)</span> is the function to be maximized and <span class="math inline">\(g(x, y)=0\)</span> is the constraint to be respected.
Notice that <span class="math inline">\(\max _{x, y}\)</span> means that we must solve (maximize) with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Construct the Lagrangian</strong></p>
<p>Create a new function called the Lagrangian by combining the objective function
and the constraints using Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian introduces new variables,
known as Lagrange multipliers, to account for the constraints.
The Lagrangian, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>, is a combination of the functions that explain the problem:
The <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is called the <em>Lagrange Multiplier</em>.
<span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda)=F(x, y)-\lambda g(x, y)
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Determine the First-Order Conditions</strong></p>
<p>Differentiate the Lagrangian with respect to the variables of the problem (e.g., x and y)
and the Lagrange multipliers. Set the partial derivatives equal to zero to obtain
the first-order conditions. These conditions represent the necessary conditions for optimality.</p>
<p>Differentiate <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> w.r.t. <span class="math inline">\(x, y,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and equate the partial derivatives to 0:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda)}{\partial x}=0 &amp; \Leftrightarrow \frac{\partial F(x, y)}{\partial x}-\lambda \frac{\partial g(x, y)}{\partial x}=0 \\
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda)}{\partial y}=0 &amp; \Leftrightarrow \frac{\partial F(x, y)}{\partial y}-\lambda \frac{\partial g(x, y)}{\partial y}=0 \\
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda)}{\partial \lambda}=0 &amp; \Leftrightarrow g(x, y)=0
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Solve the System of Equations</strong></p>
<p>Solve the system of equations obtained from the first-order conditions to find the values of the variables and Lagrange multipliers that satisfy the optimality conditions. The solutions represent the optimal quantities that maximize or minimize the objective function subject to the given constraints.</p>
<p>By following these four steps, you can effectively apply the Lagrange multiplier method to various optimization problems with constraints. It provides a systematic approach to finding the optimal solutions while incorporating the necessary trade-offs imposed by the constraints.</p>

<span class="math display">\[H_i=\alpha \cdot \overline{O}_i + (1-\alpha)\cdot \underline{O}_i\]</span>

<p>When some information is given about the probability of occurrence of states of nature, we speak of <em>decision-making under risk</em>. The most straight forward technique to make a decision here is to maximize the expected outcome for each alternative given the probability of occurrence, <span class="math inline">\(p_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the expected utility hypothesis states that the subjective value associated with an individual’s gamble is the statistical expectation of that individual’s valuations of the outcomes of that gamble, where these valuations may differ from the Euro value of those outcomes. Thus, you should better look on the utility of a respective outcome rather than on the outcome itself because the utility and outcome do not have to be linked in a linear way. The St. Petersburg Paradox by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738 is considered the beginnings of the hypothesis.</p>

<p>Suppose a casino offers a game of chance for a single player, where a fair coin is tossed at each stage. The first time head appears the player gets $1. From then onwards, every time a head appears, the stake is doubled. The game continues until the first tails appears, at which point the player receives <span class="math inline">\(\$ 2^{k-1}\)</span>, where k is the number of tosses (number of heads) plus one (for the final tails).
For instance, if tails appears on the first toss, the player wins $0. If tails appears on the second toss, the player wins $2. If tails appears on the third toss, the player wins $4, and so on. The extensive form of the game is given in figure <a href="#fig:spextensiveform">3.6</a>.</p>

<img src="fig/spextensiveform.png" style="width:80.0%" alt=" Extensive form of the St. Petersburg paradox" />
<div class="figcaption"> Extensive form of the St. Petersburg paradox</div>
</div>
<p>Given the rules of the game, what would be a fair price for the player to pay the casino in order to enter the game?</p>
<p>To answer this question, one needs to consider the expected payout: The player has a 1/2 probability of winning $1, a 1/4 probability of winning $2, a 1/8 probability of winning $4, and so on. Thus, the overall expected value can be calculated as follows:
<span class="math display">\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{8} \cdot 4+ \frac{1}{16} \cdot 8 + \dots
\]</span>
This can be simplified as:
<span class="math display">\[
E = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \dots = + \infty.
\]</span>
That means the expected win for playing this game is an infinite amount of money. Based on the expected value, a risk-neutral individual should be willing to play the game at any price if given the opportunity.
The willingness to pay of most people who have given the opportunity to play the game deviates dramatically from the objectively calculable expected payout of the lottery. This describes the apparent paradox.</p>
<p>In the context of the St. Petersburg Paradox, it becomes evident that relying solely on expected values is inadequate for certain games and for making well-informed decisions. Expected utility, on the other hand, has been the prevailing concept used to reconcile actual behavior with the notion of rationality thus far.</p>

<div id="finite-st.-petersburg-lotteries" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Finite St. Petersburg lotteries<a href="decision-making-theory.html#finite-st.-petersburg-lotteries" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Let us assume that at the beginning, the casino and the player agrees upon how many times the coin will be tossed. So we have a finite number I of lotteries with <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq I \leq \infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>To calculate the expected value of the game, the probability <span class="math inline">\(p(i)\)</span> of throwing any number <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of consecutive head is crucial. This probability is given by
<span class="math display">\[
p(i)=\underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \cdots \frac{1}{2}}_{i \text { factors}}=\frac{1}{2^{i}}
\]</span>
The payoff <span class="math inline">\(W(I)\)</span> is, if head appears <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>-times in a row by
<span class="math display">\[
W(I)=2^{I-1}
\]</span>
The expected payoff <span class="math inline">\(E(W(I))\)</span> if the coin is flipped <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> times is then given by
<span class="math display">\[
E(W(I))=\sum_{i=1}^{I} p(i) \cdot W(i)=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{2^{i}} \cdot 2^{i-1}=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{2}=\frac{I}{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, the expected payoff grows proportionally with the maximum number of rolls. This is because at any point in the game, the option to keep playing has a positive value no matter how many times head has appeared before.
Thus, the expected value of the game is infinitely high for an unlimited number of tosses but not so for a limited number of tosses. Even with a very limited maximum number of tosses of, for example, <span class="math inline">\(I = 100\)</span>, only a few players would be willing to pay
$50 for participation. The relatively high probability to leave the game with no or very low winnings leads in general to a subjective rather low evaluation that is below the expected value.</p>
<p>In the real world, we understand that money is limited and the casino offering this game also operates within a limited budget.
Let’s assume, for example, that the casino’s maximum budget is $20,000,000. As a result, the game must conclude after 25 coin tosses because <span class="math inline">\(2^{25} = 33,554,432\)</span> would exceed the casino’s financial capacity. Consequently, the expected value of the game in this scenario would be significantly reduced to just $12.50.
Interestingly, if you were to ask people, most would still be willing to pay less than $12.50 to participate. How can we explain this? Well, it is not the expected outcome that matters but the utility that stems from the outcome.</p>

<p><em>Daniel Bernoulli</em> (1700 - 1782) worked on the paradox while being a professor in St. Petersburg. His solution builds on the conceptual separation of the expected payoff and its utility. He describes the basis of the paradox as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>``Until now scientists have usually rested their hypothesis on the assumption that all gains must be evaluated exclusively in terms of themselves, i.e., on the basis of their intrinsic qualities, and that these gains will always produce a utility directly proportionate to the gain.’’ <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bernoulli1954Exposition">Bernoulli, 1954, p. 27</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The relationship between gain and utility, however, is not simply directly proportional but rather more complex. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the game based on expected utility rather than just the expected payoff.
<span class="math display">\[
E(u(W(I)))=\sum_{i=1}^{I} p(i) \cdot u(W(i))=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{2^{i}} \cdot u\left(2^{i-1}\right)
\]</span>
Daniel Bernoulli himself proposed the following logarithmic utility function:
<span class="math display">\[
u(W)=a \cdot \ln (W),
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a positive constant. Using this function in the expected utility, we get
<span class="math display">\[
E(u(W(I)))=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{2^{i}} \cdot a \cdot \ln \left(2^{i-1}\right)=a \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{i-1}{2^{i}} \ln 2=a \cdot \ln 2 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{i-1}{2^{i}}.
\]</span>
The infinite series, <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{i-1}{2^{i}}\)</span>, converges to 1 (<span class="math inline">\(\lim _{I \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{i-1}{2^{i}}=1\)</span>). Thus, given an ex ante unbounded number of throws, the expected utility of the game is given by
<span class="math display">\[
E(u(W(\infty)))=a \cdot \ln 2 .
\]</span></p>
<p>In experiments in which people were offered this game, their willingness to pay was roughly between 2 and 3 Euro. Thus, the suggests logarithmic utility function seems to be a pretty realistic specification.
The main reason is mathematically that the increasing expected payoff has decreasing marginal utility and hence the utility function reflects the risk aversion of many people.</p>

<p>A result of an <em>experiment</em> is called an <em>outcome</em>. An experiment is a planned operation carried out under controlled conditions. Flipping a fair coin twice is an example of an experiment.
The <em>sample space</em> of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes.
The Greek letter <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> is often used to denote the sample space. For example, if you flip a fair coin, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega = \{H, T\}\)</span> where the outcomes heads and tails are denoted with <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Sample space</strong>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<p>Probability is a measure that is associated with how certain we are of outcomes of a particular experiment or activity. The probability of an event <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, written <span class="math inline">\(P(A)\)</span>, is defined as
<span class="math display">\[
P(A)=\frac{\text{Number of outcomes favorable to the occurrence of } A}{\text{Total number of equally likely outcomes}}=\frac{n(A)}{n(\Omega)}
\]</span>
For example, A dice has 6 sides with 6 different numbers on it. In particular, the set of <em>elements</em> of a dice is <span class="math inline">\(M=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)</span>. Thus, the probability to receive a 6 is 1/6 because we look for one wanted outcome in six possible outcomes.</p>

<p>Events are dependent when one event affects the outcome of the other. If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are dependent events then the probability of both occurring is the product of the probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the probability of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> <em>after</em> <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has occurred:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    P(A \cap B)&amp;=P(A)\cdot P(B|A),\\
    \Leftrightarrow P(B|A)&amp;=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}\cdot
\end{align*}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(|A\)</span> stands for <code>after A has occurred', or</code>given A has occurred’. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(P(B|A)\)</span> is the probability of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. This equation is also known as the <strong>Multiplication Rule</strong>.</p>
<p>The conditional probability of A given B is written <span class="math inline">\(P(A|B)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(P(A|B)\)</span> is the probability that event A will occur given that the event B has already occurred. A conditional reduces the sample space. We calculate the probability of A from the reduced sample space B. The formula to calculate <span class="math inline">\(P(A|B)\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P\left(A\cap B\right)}{P\left(B\right)}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(P(B)\)</span> is greater than zero.
This formula is also known as <strong>Bayes’ Theorem</strong>, which is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities, states that
<span class="math display">\[
P(A)P(B|A)=P(B)P(A|B)
\]</span>
This is true since <span class="math inline">\(P(A \cap B)=P(B \cap A)\)</span> and due to the fact that <span class="math inline">\(P(A\cap B)=P(B\mid A)P(A)\)</span>, we can write Bayes’ Theorem as
<span class="math display">\[P(A\mid B)={\frac {P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}}.\]</span>
The box below summarizes the important facts w.r.t. Bayes’ Theorem.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we toss a fair, six-sided die. The sample space is
<span class="math inline">\(\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be 2 and 3 and let <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be even (2, 4, 6). To calculate <span class="math inline">\(P(A|B)\)</span>, we count the number of outcomes 2 or 3 in the sample space <span class="math inline">\(B = \{2, 4, 6\}\)</span>. Then we divide that by the number of outcomes <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (rather than <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>).</p>
<p>We get the same result by using the formula. Remember that <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> has six outcomes.
<span class="math display">\[P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(B\cap A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{\text{number of outcomes that are 2 or 3 AND even}}{6}}{\frac{\text{number of outcomes that are even}}{6}}=\frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{3}{6}}=\frac{1}{3} \]</span></p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Bayes’ Theorem<a href="decision-making-theory.html#bayes-theorem" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The theorem states that
<span class="math display">\[P(A\mid B)={\frac {P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}} \]</span>
if <span class="math inline">\(P(B)\neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are events. It simply uses the following logical facts:
<span class="math display">\[P(B\cap A)=P(A\cap B),\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(A\mid B)=\frac {P(A\cap B)}{P(B)},  \text{ and}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(B\mid A)=\frac {P(A\cap B)}{P(A)},\]</span>
or, to put it in one line:
<span class="math display">\[  P(A\cap B)= P(B\cap A)=P(A\mid B)P(B)=P(B\mid A)P(A).   \]</span>
Sometimes, it is helpful to re-write the Theorem as follows:
<span class="math display">\[P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|\neg B)P(\neg B),  \text{ and}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A),\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Example: Purse</strong></p>
<p>A purse contains four € 5 bills, five € 10 bills and three € 20 bills. Two bills are selected randomly without the first selection being replaced. Find the probability that two € 5 bills are selected.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions:</strong> There are four € 5 bills. There are a total of twelve bills.
The probability to select at first a € 5 bill then is <span class="math inline">\(P(\text{€} 5) = \frac{4}{12}\)</span>.
As the the result of the first draw affects the probability of the second draw, we have to consider that there are only three € 5 bills left and there are a total of eleven bills left. Thus,
<span class="math display">\[
P(\text{€} 5 | \text{€} 5)=\frac{3}{11}
\]</span>
and
<span class="math display">\[
P(\text{€} 5 \cap \text{€} 5) = P(\text{€} 5) \cdot P(\text{€} 5 | \text{€} 5) = \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{3}{11}=\frac{1}{11}.
\]</span>
The probability of drawing a € 5 bill and then another € 5 bill is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{11}\)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Cognitive biases in decision making<a href="decision-making-theory.html#cognitive-biases" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In section <a href="decision-making-basics.html#bounded-rationality">2.7</a>, we discussed how human beings have limited cognitive abilities to arrive at optimal solutions. Behavioral economics, pioneered by Amos Tversky (1937-1996) and 2002 Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahnemann (*1934), has identified several biases that explain why and when people fail to act perfectly rationally. In the following sections, we will explore some of the most prominent biases that arise from humans relying on heuristics in decision-making. Specifically, we will describe biases result from the use of availability, representative, and confirmation heuristics and can lead to flawed decision-making and negative outcomes for individuals and organizations. By recognizing and accounting for these biases, we can make better decisions.</p>
<div id="availability-heuristic" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.5.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.1</span> Availability heuristic<a href="decision-making-theory.html#availability-heuristic" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>availability heuristic</strong> refers to our tendency to make judgments or decisions based on information that is easily retrievable from memory. For example, if someone hears a lot of news about a particular stock or investment, they may be more likely to invest in it, even if there are other better investment options available. This bias can also lead individuals to overestimate the frequency of certain events, such as the likelihood of a market crash, based on recent media coverage.</p>
</div>
<div id="representative-heuristic" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.5.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.2</span> Representative heuristic<a href="decision-making-theory.html#representative-heuristic" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>representative heuristic</strong> refers to our tendency to make judgments based on how similar something is to a stereotype or preconceived notion. For example, an investor might assume that a company with a flashy website and marketing materials is more successful than a company with a more low-key image, even if the latter is actually more profitable. This bias can also lead to assumptions about the performance of certain investment strategies based on their resemblance to other successful strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="confirmation-heuristic" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.5.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.5.3</span> Confirmation heuristic<a href="decision-making-theory.html#confirmation-heuristic" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>confirmation heuristic</strong> refers to our tendency to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. For example, an investor who strongly believes in the potential of a particular investment might only read news and analysis that supports their belief and ignore any information that suggests otherwise. This can lead to a failure to consider potential risks and downsides of an investment.</p>

<p>You are financially literate if you understand and manage personal finances effectively. It involves having a basic understanding of financial concepts, such as budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt. Financial literacy also includes knowledge of financial products and services, such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and insurance.
Being financially literate means having the skills and knowledge to make informed financial decisions, and being able to assess risks and opportunities when it comes to managing money. It is an important life skill that can help individuals achieve their financial goals, build wealth, and avoid financial pitfalls.</p>
<p>Being better-educated was always associated with having more financial knowledge (Figure
1) across the countries we examined,3 yet we also found that education is not enough. That
is, even well-educated people are not necessarily savvy about money.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, financial illiteracy is widespread. While being better-educated is associated with making better financial decisions on average, “even well-educated people are not necessarily savvy about money” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Mitchell2015Financial">Mitchell &amp; Lusardi, 2015, p. 3</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There are various attempts to assess the levels of financial literacy. See <a href="https://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-education/measuringfinancialliteracy.htm" class="uri">https://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-education/measuringfinancialliteracy.htm</a> for example.</p>

<li>Suppose you put money in the bank for 2 years and the bank agrees to add 15% per year to your account. Will the bank add more money to your account the second year than it did the first year, or will it add the same amount of money both years?

<li>Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the bank adds 10% per year to the account. How much money would you have in the account after 5 years if you did not remove any money from the account?

</ol>
<p>These questions cover four fields of financial literacy, i.e., risk diversification, inflation and purchasing power, numeracy (simple calculations related to interest rates), and compound interest (interest payments increase exponentially over time).

<p>Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on principal plus interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, or adding it to the loaned capital rather than paying it out, or requiring payment from borrower, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest.</p>

<p>Suppose a principal amount of $1,500 is deposited in a bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded quarterly. Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with <span class="math inline">\(P = 1500\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.043\)</span> (4.3%), <span class="math inline">\(n = 4\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t = 6\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
A=1500\times\left(1+\frac{0.043}{4}\right)^{4\times 6}\approx 1938.84

<p>So the amount <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> after 6 years is approximately $1,938.84.</p>
<p>Subtracting the original principal from this amount gives the amount of interest received: <span class="math inline">\(1938.84-1500=438.84\)</span></p>

<p>The present is the value of an expected income stream determined as of the date of valuation. The present value is usually less than the future value because money has interest-earning potential, a characteristic referred to as the time value of money, except during times of zero- or negative interest rates, when the present value will be equal or more than the future value. Time value can be described with the simplified phrase, ``A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow’‘. Here, ’worth more’ means that its value is greater than tomorrow. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because the dollar can be invested and earn a day’s worth of interest, making the total accumulate to a value more than a dollar by tomorrow.</p>

<p>When making decisions about financial products such as investments or loans, it is important to consider their long-term impact on your finances. <em>Net Present Value</em> (NPV) and <em>Internal Rate of Return</em> (IRR) are two key indicators that can help guide decision making and determine whether a financial product is a good investment.</p>
<p>Net Present Value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of all cash inflows and the present value of all cash outflows over a given time period. The formula to calculate NPV is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NPV = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n} - C_0 \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(C_n\)</span> denotes net cash inflow during the period <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> the discount rate, or the cost of capital, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> the number of periods, and <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span> the initial investment.</p>
<p>In other words, NPV helps determine the current value of future cash flows, adjusted for the time value of money. A positive NPV indicates that an investment is expected to generate a return greater than the cost of capital, while a negative NPV suggests that the investment is likely to result in a loss.</p>
<p>Internal Rate of Return (IRR), on the other hand, is the discount rate that makes the NPV of all cash inflows equal to the NPV of all cash outflows. The formula to calculate IRR is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 0 = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{C_n}{(1+IRR)^n}  \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(C_n\)</span> denotes the net cash inflow during the period <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(IRR\)</span> the internal rate of return, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> the number of periods, and <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span> the initial investment.</p>
<p>IRR can be thought of as the rate of return an investment generates over time, taking into account the time value of money. When comparing different investment opportunities, a higher IRR generally indicates a more profitable investment.</p>
<p>Both NPV and IRR are important tools to help individuals make informed decisions about financial products. By comparing the NPV and IRR of different investment options, individuals can determine which investments are likely to generate the greatest returns over time, and which products may not be worth the initial investment.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while NPV and IRR are useful indicators for decision making, they are not the only factors to consider. Individuals should also consider other important factors such as risk, liquidity, and diversification when evaluating different financial products. By taking a holistic approach and considering all relevant factors, individuals can make informed decisions that are best suited to their financial goals and circumstances.</p>

<p>Most data are recorded for discrete periods of time (e.g., quarters, years). Consequently, it is often useful to model economic dynamics in discrete periods of time. A good linear approximation to a growth rate from time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t=1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\ln x_0 - \ln x_1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{x_1 - x_0}{x_0} \approx \ln x_1 - \ln x_0
\]</span></p>
<p>Let us prove that with some numbers of per capita real GDP for the US and Japan in 1950 and 1989:</p>
<p>What are the annual average growth rates over this period for the US and Japan? Here is one way to answer this question:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_{1989} = (1 + g)^{39} \cdot Y_{1950}
\]</span></p>
<p>Consequently, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> can be calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(1 + g) = \left(\frac{Y_{1989}}{Y_{1950}}\right)^{\frac{1}{39}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Yielding <span class="math inline">\(g = 0.0195\)</span> for the US and <span class="math inline">\(g = 0.0597\)</span> for Japan. The US grew at an average growth rate of about 2% annually over the period, while Japan grew at about 6% annually.</p>
<p>The following method gives a close approximation to the answer above and will be useful in other contexts. A useful approximation is that for any small number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\ln (1 + x) \approx x\)</span></p>
<p>Now, we can take the natural log of both sides of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{Y_{1989}}{Y_{1950}} = (1 + g)^{39}
\]</span></p>
<p>to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\ln (Y_{1989}) - \ln (Y_{1950}) = 39 \cdot \ln (1 + g)
\]</span></p>
<p>which rearranges to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\ln (1 + g) = \frac{\ln (Y_{1989}) - \ln (Y_{1950})}{39}
\]</span></p>
<p>and using our approximation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
g \approx \frac{\ln (Y_{1989}) - \ln (Y_{1950})}{39}
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, log growth rates are good approximations for percentage growth rates. Calculating log growth rates for the data above, we get <span class="math inline">\(g \approx 0.0194\)</span> for the US and <span class="math inline">\(g \approx 0.0582\)</span> for Japan. The approximation is close for both.</p>

<h4>Plotting growth using the logarithm<a href="decision-making-theory.html#plotting-growth-using-the-logarithm" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Recall that, with a constant growth rate <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and starting from time 0, output in time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_t = (1 + g)^t \cdot Y_0\]</span></p>
<p>Taking natural logs of both sides, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\ln Y_t = \ln Y_0 + t \cdot \ln (1 + g)\]</span></p>
<p>We see that log output is linear in time. Thus, if the growth rate is constant, a plot of log output against time will yield a straight line. Consequently, plotting log output against time is a quick way to <strong>eyeball</strong> whether growth rates have changed over time.</p>
