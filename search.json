I completed postgraduate studies at the Interdisciplinary Graduate Center of Excellence at the IAAEU in Trier. Prior to my current position, I worked amongst others as a research assistant to Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Joachim Möller at the University of Regensburg, a post-doc at the Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies (IOS) in Regensburg, and a freelancer at Charles University in Prague.\nI gave lectures at various institutions, including TU Munich, University of Regensburg, Saarland University, and Universities of Applied Sciences in Frankfurt and Augsburg. Additionally, I was active abroad for the University of Cordoba in Spain, University of Perugia, and Petra Christian University in Surabaya, Indonesia.
