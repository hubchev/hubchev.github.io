  abstract  = {Our paper investigates the link between international outsourcing and wages utilizing a large household panel and combining it with industry-level information on industries' outsourcing activities from input-output tables. This approach avoids problems such as aggregation bias, potential endogeneity bias, and poor skill definitions that commonly hamper industry-level studies. We find that outsourcing has had a marked impact on wages. Applying two alternative skill classifications, we find evidence that a 1 percentage point increase in outsourcing reduced the wage for workers in the lowest skill categories by up to 1.5%, while it increased wages for high-skilled workers by up to 2.6%. This result is robust to a number of different specifications.

  Abstract                 = {We show how an extended theory of fair wages can be incorporated in the two-by-two Heckscher-Ohlin model. An important feature of the model is the existence of involuntary unemployment. Several results stand out. First, there is no longer a simple relation between measures of factor abundance and trade patterns. Second, factor-price equalization will generally not occur. Third, differences in social norms explain why terms of trade shocks produce nonuniform adjustments in real wages and unemployment across otherwise similar countries. Fourth, losses from trade may occur. Finally, in countries where fairness considerations are important, tariffs may increase welfare.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we examine the various links among foreign direct investment (FDI), financial markets, and economic growth. We explore whether countries with better financial systems can exploit FDI more efficiently. Empirical analysis, using crosscountry data between 1975- 1995, shows that FDI alone plays an ambiguous role in contributing to economic growth. However, countries with well-developed financial markets gain significantly from FDI. The results are robust to different measures of financial market development, the inclusion of other determinants of economic growth, and consideration of endogeneity.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

Sophisticated sectors are more likely to act as a catalyst for broad-based economic growth, rather than turning into isolated enclaves, when the economy is liberalized, the exchange rate is not overvalued, and there are good information flows. An educated workforce, external liberalization, and good information flows are important prerequisites for developing sophisticated goods and services. An appropriate macroeconomic policy is particularly important for goods, skilled labor and good information flows for services.},

  Abstract                 = {The article presents information about a survey on trade costs. Trade costs have economically sensible magnitudes and patterns across countries and regions and across goods, suggesting useful hypotheses for deeper understanding. Trade costs are richly linked to economic policy. Direct policy instruments are less important than other policies. Trade costs, broadly defined, include all costs incurred in getting a good to a final user other than the marginal cost of producing the good itself. Direct evidence on border costs shows that tariff barriers are now low in most countries, on average less than 5 percent for rich countries, and with a few exceptions are on average between 10 percent and 20 percent for developing countries. Trade costs are also highly variable across both goods and countries. Trade barriers in developing countries are higher than those reported above for industrialized countries. It is very difficult to obtain accurate measures of trade costs. Data limitations can },

  Abstract                 = { Roughly one-third of world trade is intrafirm trade. This paper starts by unveiling two systematic patterns in the volume of intrafirm trade. In a panel of industries, the share of intrafirm imports in total U. S. imports is significantly higher, the higher the capital intensity of the exporting industry. In a cross section of countries the share of intrafirm imports in total U. S. imports is significantly higher, the higher the capital-labor ratio of the exporting country. I then show that these patterns can be rationalized in a theoretical framework that combines a Grossman-Hart-Moore view of the firm with a Helpman-Krugman view of international trade. In particular, I develop an incomplete-contracting, property-rights model of the boundaries of the firm, which I then incorporate into a standard trade model with imperfect competition and product differentiation. The model pins down the boundaries of multinational firms as well as the international location of production, and it is shown to predict the patterns of intrafirm trade identified above. Econometric evidence reveals that the model is consistent with other qualitative and quantitative features of the data. © 2001 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology},

  Abstract                 = {How does the formation of cross-country teams affect the organization of work and the structure of wages? To study this question, we propose a theory of the assignment of heterogeneous agents into hierarchical teams, where less skilled agents specialize in production and more skilled agents specialize in problem solving. We first analyze the properties of the competitive equilibrium of the model in a closed economy, and show that the model has a unique and efficient solution. We then study the equilibrium of a two-country model (North and South), where countries differ in their distributions of ability, and in which agents in different countries can join together in teams. We refer to this type of integration as globalization. Globalization leads to better matches for all southern workers but only for the best northern workers. As a result, we show that globalization increases wage inequality among nonmanagers in the South, but not necessarily in the North. We also study how globaliza},

  Abstract                 = {An extensive literature has analysed the economic effects of transition patterns in Central and Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries. With few recent exceptions, analysis of the impacts of speed and sequencing of reforms has not concerned the dynamics of income inequality. In this paper we analyse the heterogeneous effects of transition reforms on inequality by explicitly considering their speed and sequencing. To this aim we identify seven transition models in which the 27 countries considered can be classified. The dynamic panel econometric analysis for the period 1989–2006 reveals that balanced transition patterns, which favoured a coordination of reforms especially in specific fields, were relatively less pro-inequality.},

Our nonparametric cross-section estimates of ex post long-run treatment effects are much more stable across years and have more economically plausible values than corresponding OLS cross-section estimates from typical gravity equations. We provide plausible estimates of the long-run effects of membership in the original European Economic Community (EEC) and the Central American Common Market (CACM) between 1960 and 2000 and the estimates confirm anecdotal reports of these agreements' effectiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {Global supply chains (GSCs) are transforming the world. This paper explores why they emerged, why they are significant and future directions they are likely to take along with some implications for policy. After putting global supply chains into an historical perspective, the paper presents an economic framework for understanding the functional and geographical unbundling of production. The fundamental trade off in supply chain fractionalisation is between specialisation gains and coordination costs. The key trade-off in supply chain dispersion is between dispersion and agglomeration forces. Supply-chain trade should be not viewed as standard trade in parts and components rather than final goods. Production sharing has linked cross-border flows of goods, investment, services, know-how and people in novel ways. The paper suggest that future of global supply chains will be influenced by: 1) improvements in coordination technology that lowers the cost of functional and geographical unbundling, 2) improvements in computer integrated manufacturing that lowers the benefits of specialisation and shifts stages toward greater skill-, capital, and technology-intensity, 3) narrowing of wage gaps that reduces the benefit of North-South offshoring to nations like China, and 4) the price of oil that raises the cost of unbundling.},

The rapid internationalisation of production in the last two decades has meant that gross trade flows are increasingly unrepresentative of the value added flows. This fact has important implications for the estimation of the gravity equation. We present empirical evidence that the standard gravity equation performs poorly by some measures when it is applied to bilateral flows where parts and components trade is important. We also provide a simple theoretical foundation for a modified gravity equation that is suited to explaining trade where international supply chains are important.},

Countries with higher human capital also have lower fertility rates and higher ratios of physical investment to GDP. Growth is inversely related to the share of government consumption in GDP, but insignificantly related to the share of public investment. Growth rates are positively related to measures of political stability and inversely related to a proxy for market distortions.},

Using data for 20 OECD countries over the 1980– 2000 period, we show that inter-industry trade changes contrary to countries’ pre- vious specialization are frequently the dominant form of trade expansion. The econometric analysis indicates that the observed changes in trade patterns were ex- plained by initial endowments of human-capital and industry-speci?c changes in labour productivity and labour costs. The results also suggest that trade liberaliza- tion induced an increase in the previous specialization of larger OECD economies in industries with increasing returns to scale. JEL no. F1, O33, O50},

The paper uses the Li-Racine (2004) generalized kernel estimation methodology to examine the role of skill and technology content of the exports in understanding differential level of economic performance across countries and country groups. In the extended model, we also control for other factors that influence economic performance such as availability of financial capital and effective foreign market access of exports of developing countries. The paper uses the database from the United Nations COMTRADE Harmonized System (HS) four-digit level of disaggregation to provide new system of classification of traded goods by assigning each one of them according to their skill and technology content as proposed in Basu (forthcoming). The analysis is carried out for a set of 88 developing countries over 1995 to 2007. Similar to parametric results, the nonparametric analysis lends further support to the view that as the skill and technology content of the exports increase, the impact on GDP per capita increases positivity and significantly as well, after controlling for other policy variables.},

  Abstract                 = { Does financial development translate into a comparative advantage in industries that use more external finance? The author uses industry-level data on firms' dependence on external finance for 36 industries and 56 countries to examine this question. It is shown that countries with better-developed financial systems have higher export shares and trade balances in industries that use more external finance. These results are robust to the use of alternative measures of external dependence and financial development and are not due to reverse causality or simultaneity bias.

His theoretical model focuses on the role of financial intermediaries in facilitating large-scale, high-return projects. Results show that economies with better developed financial sectors have a comparative advantage in manufacturing industries. He provides evidence for this hypothesis, first proposed by Kletzer and Bardhan (1987), using a 30-year panel of data for 65 countries. Controlling for country-specific effects and possible reverse causality, he shows that financial development exerts a large causal impact on the level of both exports and the trade balance of manufactured goods.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

Starting from a theoretically well-founded general-equilibrium framework, where specialization depends on relative factor endowments and technological differences, we study the possible additional effect of labor unions. Using country–year panel data, we obtain that they are an important determinant of relative economic performance for a sample of manufacturing sectors. In particular low wages–labor-intensive industries turn out to be relatively disadvantaged, while high wages–capital-intensive sectors are relatively advantaged by stronger labor unions. We also allow for different institutional scenarios, letting unionization patterns interact with different regimes of bargaining coordination and social security systems. Our main conclusions are not substantially altered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

What is missing? A recent literature suggests paying more attention to the role of the domestic institutional environment. The level and nature of development of the relevant institutions may be shown to affect competitiveness, by altering both production and transaction costs. In the extreme case, alternative institutional architectures that emerge in different countries may be interpreted as the cause of relative advantage/disadvantage even if technological levels, factor endowments and tastes are identical everywhere. Although in standard international trade models institutions remain implicit, it is hard to explain trade patterns and international competitiveness without taking institutions explicitly into consideration.

Starting from a theoretically well founded neoclassical framework, where specialization depends on relative factor endowments and technological differences, we study the role of the institutional diversity in the labor market. We use an international trade model where endogenous effort is included in an otherwise standard production function. Since the effort level can be affected by country-specific labor institutions, the institutional context may in turn be able to influence the international comparative advantage. After illustrating the theoretical motivations for such an effect, we implement a rigorous econometric analysis on a group of OECD countries to test its empirical validity. We obtain that institutions have an important role in explaining the relative economic performance of a number of manufacturing sectors. In particular, stronger labor market institutions are found to advantage capital-intensive sectors and disadvantage labor-intensive ones. Policy implications are derived and discussed},

  Abstract                 = {This paper finds that currency unions and direct exchange rate pegs raise trade through distinct channels. Panel data analysis of the period 1973-2000 indicates that currency unions have raised trade predominantly at the extensive margin, the entry of new firms or products. In contrast, direct pegs have worked almost entirely at the intensive margin, increased trade of existing products. A stochastic general equilibrium model is developed to understand this result, featuring price stickiness and firm entry under uncertainty. Because both regimes tend to reliably provide exchange rate stability over the horizon of a year or so, which is the horizon of price setting, they both lead to lower export prices and greater demand for exports. But because currency unions historically are more durable over a longer horizon than pegs, they encourage firms to make the longer-term investment needed to enter a new market. The model predicts that when exchange rate uncertainty is completely and permanently eliminated, all of the adjustment in trade should occur at the extensive margin.},

  abstract    = {Despite the fact that importing and exporting are extremely rare firm activities, economists generally devote little attention to the role of firms when discussing international trade. This paper summarizes key differences between trading and non-trading firms, demonstrates how these differences present a challenge to standard trade models and shows how recent ?heterogeneous-firm? models of international trade address these challenges. We then make use of transaction-level U.S. trade data to introduce a number of new stylized facts about firms and trade. These facts reveal that the extensive margins of trade ? that is, the number of products firms trade as well as the number of countries with which they trade ? are central to understanding the well-known role of distance in dampening aggregate trade flows.},

This paper develops a model of industry equilibrium in which firms endogenously sort across products and characterizes the resulting bias in measured firm and aggregate productivity. Calibrating the model's parameters, we show that endogenous product selection can have quantitatively important effects on measured firm and aggregate productivity and their response to changes in parameter values.

  Abstract                 = { This paper examines how country, industry, and firm characteristics interact in general equilibrium to determine nations' responses to trade liberalization. When firms possess heterogeneous productivity, countries differ in relative factor abundance, and industries vary in factor intensity, falling trade costs induce reallocations of resources both within and across industries and countries. These reallocations generate substantial job turnover in all sectors, spur relatively more creative destruction in comparative advantage industries than in comparative disadvantage industries, and magnify ex ante comparative advantage to create additional welfare gains from trade. The improvements in aggregate productivity as countries liberalize dampen and can even reverse the real-wage losses of scarce factors. Copyright 2007, Wiley-Blackwell.},

I extend Helpman (1984)by identifying additional restrictions that characterize the free trade equilibrium. I illustrate that the complete set of restrictions are the building blocks of a multi-cone factor content specification which is the factor content dual to Alan Deardorff's (1979)well-known chain of comparative advantage goods prediction. The theoretical analysis implies that the existing tests of Helpman are incomplete. Applying the complete set of restrictions to Choi and Krishna's data set of 8 OECD countries, I find limited empirical support. This is compatible with previous studies suggesting that OECD countries do not occupy different cones.},

First, there is a strong convergence effect in productivity, both at the country and at the industry level. Second, FDI inflow plays an important role in accounting for productivity growth. Third, the impact of FDI on productivity critically depends on the absorptive capacity of recipient countries and industries. Fourth, there is important heterogeneity across countries, industries and time with respect to some of the main findings.

  Abstract                 = {This chapter examines the impact of wage-setting institutions and government policies on wages and employment, focusing on the OECD countries. There is considerable evidence that centralized collective bargaining, minimum wages and antidiscrimination policies raise the relative wages of the low paid. Evidence of the impact of these institutions and other policies such as mandated severance pay, advance notice or unemployment insurance is more mixed with some studies finding negative employment effects while others do not. This may reflect the adoption by many OECD countries of off-setting policies, such as public employment, temporary employment contracts and active labor market programs, which, while they may have reduced the adverse relative employment effects of their less flexible labor market institutions on the low skilled, appear not to have prevented high overall unemployment.},

Portage sites attracted commerce and supporting services, and places where the falls provided water power attracted manufacturing during early industrialization. We examine portage sites in the U.S. South, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest, including those on the fall line, a geomorphological feature in the southeastern United States marking the final rapids on rivers before the ocean. Although their original advantages have long since become obsolete, we document the continuing importance of historical portage sites. We interpret these results as path dependence and contrast explanations based on sunk costs interacting with decreasing versus increasing returns to scale. Copyright 2012, Oxford University Press.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper examines spillover effects of the activities of multinational firms. Such effects are most likely to be found in host countries, where the operations of foreign multinationals may influence local firms in the MNCs own industry as well as firms in other industries. However, there is no comprehensive evidence on the exact nature or magnitude of these effects, although it is suggested that host country spillovers vary systematically between countries and industries. In particular, the positive effects of foreign investment are likely to increase with the level of local capability and competition. The spillovers to the home countries of MNCs are often more difficult to identify, for various reasons. Earlier studies suggest that the effects are generally positive, but the increasing international division of labor within multinationals complicates the analysis. The impact on the home country is likely to depend on what activities these firms concentrate at home. Copyright 1998 by Blackwell Publishers Ltd},

  Abstract                 = {The relations between economic growth and international labor standards are explored in a panel of 121 countries from 1974 to 2004. A large literature has empirically tested the neoclassical and endogenous growth models using cross-sectional or panel regressions. Here, the growth model is augmented with labor standards. A dynamic panel data model is used to account for the endogeneity of the determinants of economic growth and labor standards. Two measures of labor standards are used: the rate of work injuries and the rate of strikes and lockouts. The estimation results show that higher levels of labor standards are associated with higher rates of economic growth. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  Abstract                 = {There is ample evidence that a country's labour market institutions are important determinants of unemployment. This study generalises Davis' (1998) idea according to which the institutions of the trade partners matter also for a country's equilibrium unemployment rate as they generate comparative advantages. Moreover, the empirical investigation provides some evidence that the interactions between bilateral trade and relative labour market regulations affect the equilibrium unemployment rate. Given data limitations in this area, the ambition of this paper is merely to draw the attention to the general relevance of these interactions as complementing factors to other explanations of unemployment. Another interesting finding is that a fairly low regulated country like Canada can be negatively affected because its main trading partner is even less regulated, while a high regulated country like Germany appears rather sheltered because its trading partners are also highly regulated.},

  Abstract                 = {Manufacturing and vertical specialization (VS) trade, trade in goods that incorporate imported inputs, has grown rapidly since the 1960s. I argue that declining trade costs are an important explanation for these facts. I present a three stage vertical specialization trade model, with raw materials, manufactured parts and final goods sectors. In the simulated model, falling trade costs explain much of the observed growth in overall and VS trade. Manufacturing trade grows twice as fast as overall trade. Raw materials trade was more important in the 1960s when trade costs were high, since their production is more strongly linked to endowments than manufacturing. Therefore, materials will be traded even when trade costs are high. Trade costs have fallen more for manufactured goods over the last 40 years, leading to a rapid expansion of manufactured parts trade relative to materials.},

Employing a recent survey of more than half a million Germans on a wide range of social and political issues we confirm that differences in amenities give rise to substantial differences in land prices. With regard to wages, however, we find only little effects of amenities. Relying on the land-price effects we assess the quality of life in each of the German counties and provide a comprehensive ranking.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

Special emphasis is given to estimating potentially complex parametric or nonparametric models, including generalized linear and additive models as well as regression models for survival analysis. Concepts of degrees of freedom and corresponding Akaike or Bayesian information criteria, particularly useful for regularization and variable selection in high-dimensional covariate spaces, are discussed as well. The practical aspects of boosting procedures for fitting statistical models are illustrated by means of the dedicated open-source software package mboost. This package implements functions which can be used for model fitting, prediction and variable selection. It is flexible, allowing for the implementation of new boosting algorithms optimizing user-specified loss functions.},

  Abstract                 = {Since 1980, the aggregate income of oil-exporting countries relative to that of oil- poor countries has been remarkably constant despite structural gaps in productivity growth rates. This stylized fact is analyzed in a two-country model where resource- poor (Home) and resource-rich (Foreign) economies display productivity differences but stable income shares due to terms-of-trade dynamics. We show that Home's income share is positively related to the national tax on domestic resource use, a prediction confirmed by dynamic panel estimations for sixteen oil-poor economies. National governments have incentives to deviate from both efficient and laissez-faire allocations. In Home, increasing the oil tax improves welfare through a rent-transfer mechanism. In Foreign, subsidies (taxes) on domestic oil use improve welfare if R\&D productivity is lower (higher) than in Home.},

Recent research identifies the origin of the legal system as being a major determinant of the cross-country variation in the rigidity of employment protection legislation. However, the supporting evidence is largely confined to levels of regulation and is almost exclusively based on international cross-section data for the post-1995 period. This paper introduces a new index capturing the rigidity of employment protection legislation (LAMRIG) for an unbalanced panel of more than 140 countries over time starting in 1960. Although the importance of legal origins in explaining the level of rigidity of labor regulations across countries is replicated using LAMRIG, their explanatory power is much weakened for changes over time (1960-2004.) More important as determinants of such changes are the level of development and other reforms such as trade liberalization. With respect to the effects of changes in the rigidity of labor regulations on growth and inequality, which have been very controversial in the literature, results with LAMRIG support Freeman's conjecture that changes in rigidity do not systematically affect economic growth but do lower income inequality.},

  abstract  = { The accession of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries to the European Union (EU) is expected to lead to the new member countries becoming more like the older members, including in terms of trade. In this paper, we focus on two factors promoting CEE-EU trade integration: trade liberalization and institutional reforms. Measures of trade liberalization undertaken by both parties during the 1990s were very substantial, but did not always produce the expected upsurge of regional trade flows. Much less progress has been made in improving the functioning of CEE institutions (e.g., progress in the privatization process or in reducing corruption). Countries where most important changes at the institutional level occurred were also those that most increased their trade with the EU. Comparing the impact of these two factors, we find that improving institutions in CEE countries can generate as much trade as the removal of all tariff and non-tariff barriers. The paper also addresses the issue of the presence of reversed causality between trade and institutions, and the pro-trade effect of institutional similarity.

To study the way in which the European Union copes with the emergence of new big world exporters in this context, we analyse the redistribution of world market shares at the level of product variety. We distinguish for each product three price ranges. We decompose the growth of exports into structural effects (geographic and sectoral) and into a pure performance effect. From 1994 to 2007 the EU25 withstood the competition of emerging countries better than the U.S. and Japan. European market share losses arise during the 1994-2000 period, and are mainly explained by poor export performance of old member states. More precisely, the EU gains market shares in the upper segment of the market, by cumulating good performance and favourable structure effects, contrary to the U.S. and Japan which withdraw extensively from this segment of the market. Finally, all developed countries lose market shares in high-technology products to developing countries, with the EU losing less than other countries.},

For low-value apparel products, which tend to compete on price, labor costs were a significant determinant of trade flows, causing production to be dispersed to low-wage areas. For high-value products, which tend to compete on quality, fashion, and quick response to changing demand conditions, production for export tended to take place near fabric suppliers and final markets, which tend to be in higher-wage areas. Apparel production cannot be characterized exclusively according to the New International Division of Labor (NIDL) hypothesis or by other explanations based on comparative factor costs. Proximity to markets and suppliers often outweighs the importance of labor costs, particularly for high-end apparel production.},

  abstract  = {The gravity equation has been widely used in studying the determinants of bilateral trade flows. Despite their dubious theoretical foundations gravity models have been extremely successful empirically. All theoretical attempts to provide a formal justification for the gravity equation assume complete specialization in production. This leads to a misleading impression that complete specialization is a necessary condition for deriving the gravity equation. In this paper we demonstrate formally that the gravity equation can be derived also from a variety of incomplete specialization models based on both neoclassical and monopolistic competition assumptions. The common prediction that emerges from these models is that factor proportion variables, along with the country size variables, play a key role in determination of bilateral trade volumes, however, their impact is model specific. The neglect of these variables in empirical studies employing gravity equations derived from complete spe},

In contrast to previous empirical work, we find that industrial specialization and scale indicators affect TFP growth positively, while neither product variety nor the degree of local competition have any effect. Employment-based regressions yield nearly the opposite results, in line with most of previous empirical work. We argue that such regressions suffer from serious identifica-tion problems when interpreted as evidence of dynamic externalities. Our results question the conclusions of most of the existing literature on dynamic agglomeration economies. (JEL: R11, O47) Copyright (c) 2004 The European Economic Association.},

  Abstract                 = {Current research in international trade literature centers on the importance of both the intensive margin (i.e. the volume exported by an exporter) and extensive margin (i.e. new exporters) to model export behavior. In this paper I empirically study the behavior of the intensive and the extensive margin to address the elasticity puzzle in international economics. (The puzzle arises because the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods has no consensus estimate and is thought to be low in international macro models and high in trade models.) In particular, I study if mechanisms related to sectoral differences in market structure or development status of the traders have potential to address the elasticity puzzle. I further study the extensive margin of trade and its connection to credit constraints. A bilateral trade sample of 136 countries is used for the period 1981-1997 and bilateral export responses to bilateral real exchange rate fluctuations are decomposed into intensive and extensive margin responses. I find that the extensive margin of trade has a significant role in overall yearly export responses to real exchange rate fluctuations. Moreover the extensive margin shows a larger role among less substitutable exports (as predicted by Chaney, 2008). Taken together, these findings suggest that sectoral differences in market structure may account for higher estimates of the substitution elasticity for differentiated sectors. Alternatively, the development status of the exporter is found to affect export responses suggesting that elasticity estimates would be higher for more developed exporters. Lastly, credit constraints, measured as external finance dependence of the sector, are found to play a significant role in extensive margin behavior. Given the importance of the extensive margin in overall export responses, the evidence on credit constraints may provide another explanation for heterogeneity in estimates of the substitution elasticity.},

The core of our analysis lies in the determinants of the division of labor. We consider a world economy comprising two large countries, with a continuum of goods and one factor of production, labor. Each good is characterized by its complexity, defined as the number of tasks that must be performed to produce one unit. There are increasing returns to scale in the performance of each task, which creates gains from specialization, and uncertainty in the enforcement of each contract, which create transaction costs. The trade-off between these two forces pins down the size of productive teams across sectors in each country. Under free trade, the country where teams are larger specializes in the more complex goods. In our model, it is the country where the product of institutional quality and human per worker capital is larger. Hence, better institutions and more e},

The hypothesis that exports in technology-intensive industries have a higher potential for positive externalities coupled with higher productivity levels (due to higher rates of capitalisation) is tested using a comprehensive and detailed data set,covering 45 industrialised and developing countries and including exports of 33 industries over the time period 1981 to 1997. The estimation results, using a random effects model and employing an instrumental variables estimator, support the hypothesis of qualitative differences between high and low tech exports with respect to output growth. The superior performance of high tech exports stems from their positive productivity differential to the domestic sector, while the externality effect is not significant at any meaningful level of significance. The positive productivity differential is only significant for the subsample of developing countries. No significant effects were found to be present in the subsample of OECD member countries.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a two-sector general equilibrium model in which equilibrium unemployment arises endogenously because of trading frictions in the labor market of one sector. Externalities inherent in the search process lead to inefficient equilibria, and this has important implication for the basic structure of the economy. In particular, the relationship between factor rewards and commodity prices is fundamentally different from the analogous relationship in a frictionless economy. One implication is that the economy's relative supply curve may be downward sloping, especially when the search sector is small. We also present several applications of the analysis.},

Using spatial estimation on panel data for 148 developing countries over 18 years, we find that the labour standards in one country are positively correlated with the labour standards elsewhere (i.e. a cut in labour standards in other countries reduces labour standards in the country in question). This interdependence is more evident in labour practices (i.e. enforcement) than in labour laws. Further, competition is most fierce in those countries with already low standards.},

Our results support a hybrid theory in which locational fundamentals establish the spatial pattern of relative regional densities, but increasing returns help to determine the degree of spatial differentiation. Long-run city size is robust even to large temporary shocks.},

In recent years empirical research has begun to provide an increasingly detailed view of the determinants of trade relations. Yet the field as a whole has been slow to incorporate these findings in its fundamental worldview.

  Abstract                 = {Study of the factor content of trade has become a laboratory to test our ideas about how the key elements of endowments, production, absorption and trade fit together within a general equilibrium framework. Already a great deal of progress has been made in fitting these pieces together. Nevertheless, the existing research raises a great many questions that should help to focus empirical research in the coming years. Among the more pressing issues is a deeper consideration of the role of intermediates, the role of aggregation biases, and of differences in patterns of absorption. This work should provide a more substantial foundation for future policy work developed within a factor content framework.},

This article develops some models to study various aspects of the relationship between market and optimal resource allocation in the presence of some nonconvexities. The monopoly power, which is a necessary ingredient of markets with nonconvexities, is usually considered to distort resources away from the sector concerned. However, in the analysis monopoly power enables firms to pay fixed costs, and entry cannot be prevented, so the relationship between monopoly power and the direction of market distortion is no longer obvious. In the central case of constant elasticity utility function, the market solution was constrained Pareto optimal, regardless of the value of that elasticity. With variable elasticities, the bias could go either way, and the direction of the bias depended not on how the elasticity of demand ch},

  Abstract                 = {This paper analyzes the effect of comparative advantage in international trade on a country''s level of financial development. Countries with comparative advantage in financially intensive goods experience a higher demand for external finance, and therefore financial development. By contrast, financial development is lower in countries that primarily export goods which do not rely on external finance. We use disaggregated trade data to develop a measure of a country''s external finance need of exports, and demonstrate this effect empirically. In order to overcome the simultaneity problem, we develop a novel instrumentation strategy based on the exogenous geographic determinants of trade patterns. [Copyright 2007 Elsevier] },

  Abstract                 = {Recognizing that gains historically attributed to trade capture instead the roles of institutions and geography, we estimate the relationship between labor productivity and trade for a panel of countries, 1980 to 2000. We use real and nominal openness as measures of trade. The endogeneity of trade and institutional quality is accounted for with instruments. Our trade instrument is based on a theoretically motivated gravity equation and uses a more comprehensive data set than in related studies. Fixed- and random-effects and system-GMM panel estimation methods address potential biases associated with cross-section estimations. We find a robust relationship between real openness and labor productivity from the 1990s. Countries that trade more generate higher levels of productivity, supporting an institutional theory of growth. We find evidence that countries with low-quality institutions benefit from openness to trade and that the positive effect of trade on labor productivity is lower for more populated countries.},

One way how FDI speeds up growth is that it facilitates the manufacturing of more sophisticated products by local firms. So far, firm-level evidence is missing on how the presence of multinational firms affects the product sophistication of firms in a developing country. This paper aims to fill this gap. We compile an extensive firm-product-level dataset of Indian manufacturing firms which we complement with information on product sophistication and spillovers from FDI. We then explore different channels through which spillovers from multinationals to local Indian firms foster the manufacturing of sophisticated products. We find evidence that spillovers through supplier linkages strongly increase the manufacturing of sophisticated products in India.},

Hier werden regionale Arbeitsmärkte genutzt, die als räumliche Verwertungsbereiche des Produktionsfaktors Arbeit unverzerrte Ergebnisse liefern. - Durch Schätzung räumlicher Preisindizes ist es möglich, im Schätzansatz Nominaldurch die eigentlich ökonomisch relevanten Reallöhne zu ersetzen. - In der modernen räumlichen Ökonometrie werden Abhängigkeiten zwischen den regionalen Untersuchungseinheiten berücksichtigt, so auch in den nachstehenden Ergebnissen. - Die Lohnkurve muss nicht in allen Regionen gleich sein. Vielmehr ist es plausibler, dass sich aufgrund von Besonderheiten der Arbeitsmärkte in den Regionen die Koeffizienten des Schätzansatzes interregional voneinander unterscheiden.

  Abstract                 = {We explore the relationship between exposure to trade (as measured by openness) and child labor in a cross-country setting. Our methodology accounts for the fact that trade flows are endogenous to child labor (and labor standards more generally) by examining the relationship between child labor and variation in trade based on geography. We find that countries that trade more have less child labor. At the cross-country means, the data suggest an openness elasticity of child labor of 0.7. For low-income countries, the elasticity of child labor with respect to trade with high-income countries is 0.9. However, these relationships appear to be largely attributable to the positive association between trade and income. We consistently find a small and statistically insignificant association between openness and child labor when we control for cross-country income differences in the full sample, when we split the sample into different country groups, consider only trade between high- and low-income countries, or focus on exports of unskilledlabor intensive products from low-income countries. Thus, the cross-country data do not substantiate assertions that trade per se plays a significant role in perpetuating the high levels of child labor that pervade low-income countries.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract This paper sets up a general equilibrium model, in which firms are heterogeneous due to productivity differences and workers have fairness preferences and hence provide full effort only if their factor return is sufficiently high. With the wage considered to be fair by workers depending on the operating profits of the firm in which they are employed, more productive firms in this setting are not only larger and make higher profits but they also have to pay higher wages due to rent-sharing. This mechanism leads to wage differentiation even if all workers share the same individual characteristics. We use this framework to study worker-specific effects of trade between two symmetric countries. Exporters in this setting make higher operating profits and hence have to pay higher wages than non-exporters. This exporter wage premium provides a source for losses from trade and, all other things equal, makes a negative employment effect of trade more likely. Furthermore, it contributes significantly to a general increase in intra-group income inequality among production workers when a country moves from autarky to trade.

  Abstract                 = {This article develops a model that incorporates workers' fair wage preferences into a general equilibrium framework with heterogeneous firms. In a setting where the wage considered to be fair by workers depends on the productivity of the firm they are working in, we study the determinants of profits, involuntary unemployment and within-group wage inequality. We use this model to investigate the effects of globalization, thereby pointing to distributional conflicts that have so far not been accounted for: a simultaneous increase of average profits and involuntary unemployment as well as a surge in within-group wage inequality.

Basic effects are always determined by centrifugal and centripetal forces. A finding of the basic model is that transport costs can be crucial for the emergence of a center-periphery model. Likewise, historical developments influence the distribution of industries between regions significantly and enduring. This paper gives a brief introduction to the topic. The core-periphery model of Krugman (1991) is formally derived.},

However, to date, there has been little or no empirical attempt to identify a causal relation. To identify the causal impact of bohemians on economic growth, we apply an instrumental variable approach using as an exogenous instrument the geographic distribution of bohemians prior to the Industrial Revolution in Germany. This distribution was primary the result of competition for prestige between courts and not of economic prosperity. Accordingly, the instrument is independent of today’s regional economic development. Focusing on the concentration of highly skilled people today that is explained by the proximity to exogenous concentrations of bohemians, the observed local average treatment effect supports the hypothesis of a positive impact of bohemians on regional economic development.},

Ziel dieses Aufsatzes ist, ausgewählte regionalökonomische Kennziffern zur Berechnung von Konzentration/Spezialisierung leicht nachvollziehbar anhand von Beispielen darzustellen. --},

  abstract  = {Using several data sources, we assess the impact of Italy's outward foreign direct investment (FDI) on local employment growth between 1996 and 2001 for 12 manufacturing industries and 103 administrative provinces. Our main result is that, controlling for the local industrial structure and area fixed effects, FDI is associated with faster local employment growth, relatively to the national industry average. We also find that employment in small plants is not negatively influenced by higher levels of FDI. Our findings do not support therefore the idea that FDI is detrimental to local employment growth in the home country.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

  Abstract                 = {How do changes in labor market institutions, like more generous unemployment benefits in one country, affect labor market outcomes in other countries? We set up a two-country Armingtonian trade model with frictions on the goods and labor markets. Contrary to the literature, higher labor market frictions increase unemployment at home and abroad. The strength of the spillover depends on the relative size of countries and on trade costs. It is exacerbated when real wages are rigid. Using panel data for 20 rich OECD countries, and controlling for institutions as well as for business cycle comovement, we confirm our theoretical predictions. (JEL E24, F16, J64, J65)},

The percentage increases were smaller for products that were exported every year during the sample period than for products that were not, indicating significant and substantial effects on the extensive margin of trade. The euro effects were concentrated to semi-finished and finished products, in particular to industries with highly processed products such as pharmaceuticals and machinery, indicating increased international vertical specialization.

  Abstract                 = {This paper starts out from the observation that the export shares of firms (export to sales ratio) vary greatly among firms, and tend to be systematically related to the firms' capital labour ratios. This observation cannot be explained by e.g. the standard Melitz model, since it predicts that all exporting firms have identical export shares. In our model, we relate the difference in export shares to firm level differences in transport costs. Two factors influence a firm's transport cost in our model. First, firm scale can affect transportation costs. Second, we allow for an association between the capital intensity of a firm and its transportation costs. As in our data, we assume this relationship to be sector specific. Our model can generate the result that more productive and capital intensive firms have higher export shares due to scale economies in transportation, but the model can also generate the opposite pattern that more capital intensive firms have lower export shares due to a strong positive association between capital labour ratio and transportation costs. We use Japanese manufacturing firm level data to calibrate our model by matching firm level export shares to data sector by sector. Regressing the calibrated transportation costs on actual data then shows that the calibrated (calculated) numbers can explain about half of the variation in the data.},

We disentangle different spillover channels, namely export spillover, R\&D spillover and wage spillover. We also consider the heterogeneous technological behaviour of local firms considering how in-house R\&D efforts and disembodied technological imports may affect the overall exporting performance. Our findings mainly confirm that the two most important channels for export spillover are mainly the demonstration effect and the R\&D spillover effect The decision to export is influenced mainly by technological activities of local firms, confirming that R\&D is a key variable that help firms to overcome fixed costs that are crucial to start exporting. Moreover, the findings of the analysis suggest that local firms R\&D is highly relevant to internalize the positive spillover effect emanating from MNEs both with regard to decision to export and export propensity.},

Trade depends on institutional quality and exporter and importer access to well developed transport and communications infrastructure. While we emphasize exports of developing countries, low institutional and infrastructure quality in the South also limits market access for exports from the North. The pattern of results implies that policy emphasis on developing country market access while not providing enough support for trade facilitation, may be misplaced.},

I explore several common uses of RCA indexes and show that diﬀerent indexes are appropriate when attempting to (a) evaluate the differential eﬀect of changes in trade barriers across producers of different products, (b) identify countries who are relatively close competitors in a given market, or (c) recover patterns of relative productivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: Motivated by growth models based on the variety of capital goods, recent empirical studies have established links between productivity and several trade-based measures of product variety, carrying the implication that these measures may represent technology. We study this implication by explicitly proposing the variety of capital goods available for production as a direct measure of the state of technology. Within a simple growth and development framework, we derive a ‘conditional technological convergence’ hypothesis on how this variety should behave if it were indeed to represent the state of technology. The hypothesis is tested with highly disaggregated trade data, using tools from the income convergence literature. The results suggest that a trade-based count measure of the variety of available capital goods, allowing for product differentiation by country of origin, indeed behaves ‘as if’ it represented technology when change of technology is understood as a learning pr},

  Abstract                 = {Scholars and policy makers have displayed a longstanding interest in the politics of economic reform, particularly over the 1990s as former Communist countries struggled to develop market economies. Yet remarkably little systematic research has been conducted on the political economy of commercial reform in the post-Communist world. We argue that the fragmentation of power within post-Communist countries has been a potent force for trade liberalization. In non-democracies where political power is highly concentrated in the hands of a small group of elites, state leaders face few impediments to rent seeking and are well insulated from interests favouring commercial reform. In non-democracies where power is fragmented within the national government, however, new elites with weak ties to the old regime are well placed to use trade liberalization as a weapon against their political opponents. Moreover, the dispersion of power in non-democracies creates space for groups favouring free trad},

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have found a strong positive correlation between human capital, measured as the share of the adult population with a college degree, and population growth in metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) in the U.S. In this paper, I corroborate that the human capital-growth connection is indeed statistically significant, although much weaker than previously thought. The evidence suggests that the main reason behind this bias lies on endogeneity issues that have not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. In particular, omitting lagged MSA growth in regressions of current MSA growth on human capital overestimates the impact of skills by 100 per cent. Given that past growth has been shown to be one of the main drivers of current MSA growth (Glaeser 1994a), omitting the former variable in growth-education regressions would bias our human capital estimates upwards. Upon further examination, however, I show that MSA-specific fixed effects explain away the alleged impact of past on current growth. This suggests that the individual characteristics of the city that made it grew in the first place, and not lagged MSA growth per se, are what drives future MSA growth. Yet, even after accounting for these MSA-specific fixed effects, the impact of human capital on MSA growth does not disappear: my estimates suggest that a decadal increase of 10 per cent in the share of the adult population with a college degree translates into a rise of between 3 and up to 5 per cent in the MSA population growth rate during the same period. Finally, instrumental variable regressions strongly support the direction from skills to growth, abating potential reverse causality concerns.},

This paper argues that school enrollment rates by far the most commonly used human capital measure in growth regressions attempting to test these hypotheses--conflate human capital stock and accumulation effects and lead to misinterpretations of the role of labor force growth. An alternative education-related human capital measure is constructed which is capable of distinguishing between stocks and flows. Applying this measure to samples of developed and less developed countries during the 1960-85 period suggests not only that there are important growth effects associated both with 'initial' stacks of, and subsequent growth in, human capital, but also that this new measure out-performs the simple school enrollment rates used in previous analyses.

We argue that the role of urban density in facilitating consumption is extremely important and understudied. As firms become more mobile, the success of cities hinges more and more on cities' role as centers of consumption. Empirically, we find that high amenity cities have grown faster than low amenity cities. Urban rents have gone up faster than urban wages, suggesting that the demand for living in cities has risen for reasons beyond rising wages. The rise of reverse commuting suggest the same consumer city phenomena.},

  abstract  = { Recent theories of economic growth, including those of P. Romer (1986, 1990), M. Porter (1990), and J. Jacobs (1969, 1984), have stressed the role of technological spillovers in generating growth. Because such knowledge spillovers are particularly effective in cities, where communication between people is more extensive, data on the growth of industries in different cities allow the authors to test some of these theories. Using a new data set on the growth of large industries in 170 U.S. cities between 1956 and 1987, they find that local competition and urban variety, but not regional specialization, encourage employment growth in industries. The evidence suggests that important knowledge spillovers might occur between rather than within industries. Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press.},

A large amount of evidence suggests that this premium is not just the result of higher ability workers living in cities, which means that cities make workers more productive. Evidence on migrants and the cross effect between urban status and experience implies that a significant fraction of the urban wage premium accrues to workers over time and stays with them when they leave cities. Therefore, a portion of the urban wage premium is a wage growth, not a wage level, effect. This evidence suggests that cities speed the accumulation of human capital.

In the cross-section, multiproduct firms in India look remarkably similar to their U.S. counterparts. The time-series patterns, however, exhibit important differences. In contrast to evidence from the United States, product churning, particularly product rationalization, is far less common in India. We find no link between product rationalization and output tariff declines following India's 1991 trade liberalization. The lack of \&quot;creative destruction\&quot; is consistent with the role of industrial regulation in preventing an efficient allocation of resources.

  abstract    = {This paper presents an overview of India’s pharmaceutical industry and its evolution from almost non-existent to one of the world’s leading suppliers of generic drugs. The Indian pharmaceutical industry was allowed to take off when India met its WTO TRIPs obligations and amended its patent laws with the passage and implementation of the Patents (Amendments) Act 2005. When India re-instituted “product” patents, it effectively ended 36 years of protection for Indian companies and terminated legal reverse engineering or copying of patented foreign pharmaceuticals drugs. To meet the short fall in revenues, many of India’s leading pharmaceutical companies turned to foreign acquisitions and exports, especially to the United States. Indian companies benefit from a greater acceptance of generic drugs among the U.S. public, tremendous pressure on healthcare providers to reduce costs, and impending expiration of patents on drugs with annual sales of $50 billion. India’s major pharmaceutical companies are positioning themselves to offer generic versions of these drugs and some have predicted that they will capture at least 30 percent of the U.S. generic replacement market. However, Indian companies face severe price compression in the U.S. for thei generic drug market and stiff competition from domestic U.S. generic manufactures and suppliers from other low-cost countries.},

  abstract  = {We propose a theory of the global production process that focuses on tradeable tasks, and use it to study how falling costs of offshoring affect factor prices in the source country. We identify a productivity effect of task trade that benefits the factor whose tasks are more easily moved offshore. In the light of this effect, reductions in the cost of trading tasks can generate shared gains for all domestic factors, in contrast to the distributional conflict that typically results from reductions in the cost of trading goods.

  Abstract                 = {The core subjects of trade theory are the pattern and volume of trade: which goods are traded by which countries, and how much of those goods are traded. The first part of the paper discusses evidence on comparative advantage, with an emphasis on carefully connecting theory models to data analyses. The second part of the chapter first considers the theoretical foundations of the gravity model, and then reviews the small number of papers that have tried to test, rather than simply use, the implications of gravity. Both parts of the paper yield the same conclusion: we are still in the very early stages of empirically understanding specialization and the volume of trade, but the work that has been done can serve as a starting point for further research.},

  Abstract                 = {In an effort to shed some light on the larger question of labor standardsvand globalization, we seek to examine compliance with minimum wage legislation in Indonesia. Indonesia is an ideal case study because the govern ment made minimum wages a central component of its labor market policies in the 1990s. During this time, minimum wages quadrupled in nominal terms and doubled in real terms. In this paper we estimate the relationship between international competition and compliance with the statutory minimum wage in Indonesia. We identify firms facing international competition with two plant-level indica tors. First, we use the plant's export orientation as one measure of international competition. Second, we use the plant's foreign ownership as another measure of international competition. Critics claim that foreign firms are exploiting foreign workers, although our research on developing countries has shown that foreign enterprises are more likely to pay higher wages. This framework provides a direct test of the relationship between meas ures of globalization and labor standards, as defined by compliance with the regional minimum wage.},

They then test for spillovers from joint ventures to plants with no foreign investment. Foreign investment negatively affects the productivity of domestically owned plants. The net impact of foreign investment, taking into account these two offsetting effects, is quite small. The gains from foreign investment appear to be entirely captured by joint ventures.},

Using cross-country panel data on manufacturing industries, we find that labor market imperfections arising from labor regulation have a greater influence on capital intensity than do credit market imperfections. Less restrictive labor regulations are associated with lower capital intensity in manufacturing, especially in middle-income and developing economies and in sectors that either require more frequent labor adjustment or are more unskilled labor intensive. This suggests that stringent labor regulations can impose costs on labor use, thereby curtailing gains from trade based on factor-abundance driven comparative advantage.},

We argue that the assets and capabilities needed to produce one good are imperfect substitutes for those needed to produce other goods, but the degree of asset specificity varies widely. Given this, the speed of structural transformation will depend on the density of the product space near the area where each country has developed its comparative advantage. While this space is traditionally assumed to be smooth and continuous, we find that in fact it is very heterogeneous, with some areas being very dense and others quite sparse. We develop a measure of revealed proximity between products using comparative advantage in order to map this space, and then show that its heterogeneity is not without consequence. The speed at which countries can transform their productive structure and upgrade their exports depends on having a path to nearby goods that are increasingly of higher value.

  Abstract                 = {This chapter examines empirical strategies that have been or could be used to evaluate the importance of agglomeration and trade models. This theoretical approach, widely known as \&quot;New Economic Geography\&quot; (NEG), emphasizes the interaction between transport costs and firm-level scale economies as a source of agglomeration. NEG focuses on forward and backward trade linkages as causes of observed spatial concentration of economic activity. We survey the existing literature, organizing the papers we discuss under the rubric of five interesting and testable hypotheses that emerge from NEG theory. We conclude the chapter with an overall assessment of the empirical support for NEG and suggest some directions for future research.},

This finding is stable across different indicators for regional aggregate education and robust to agglomeration, wage curve, price level and amenity effects. A comparison of our results with Moretti's findings for the USA suggests that national labour market institutions influence the distribution of wage gains from aggregate regional education among workers of different educational backgrounds. An analysis by sector reveals that human capital externalities are generally more pronounced in manufacturing than in the service sector. Externalités des ressources humaines en Allemagne de l'Ouest Résumé En utilisant des données pluridimensionnelles et en faisant usage de variables instrumentales, nous sommes en mesure de démontrer que les différences salariales régionales dans les différentes régions d'Allemagne sont attribuables, en partie, à des externalités en ressources humaines localisées. Cette conclusion est stable dans les différents indices pour l’éducation globale à l’échelon régional, et solide sur le plan de l'agglomération, des courbes salariales, des niveaux de prix, et des facteurs d'agrément. Une comparaison entre nos résultats et les conclusions de Moretti, pour les États-Unis, indique que les institutions nationales du marché du travail influent sur la distribution des gains salariaux découlant de l’éducation régionale globale parmi des travailleurs provenant de différents milieux éducatifs. Une analyse par secteur révèle que les externalités de ressources humaines sont généralement plus prononcées dans le secteur industriel que dans le secteur tertiaire.

  Abstract                 = {The substantial literature investigating the links between trade, trade policy, and labor market outcomes-both returns to labor and employment-has generated a number of stylized facts, but many open questions remain. This paper surveys the subset of the literature focusing on trade policy and integration into the world economy. Although in the longer run trade opportunities can have a major impact in creating more productive and higher paying jobs, this literature tends to take employment as given. A common finding is that much of the shorter run impacts of trade and reforms involve reallocation of labor or wage impacts within sectors. This reflects a pattern of expansion of more productive firms-especially export-oriented or suppliers to exporters-and contraction and adjustment of less productive enterprises in sectors that become subject to greater import competition. Wage responses to trade and trade reforms are generally greater than employment impacts, but trade can only explain a small fraction of the general increase in wage inequality observed in both industrial and developing countries in recent decades. A feature of the literature survey is that the focus is almost exclusively on industries producing goods. Given the importance of service industries as a source of employment and determinants of competitiveness, the paper argues that one priority area for future research is to study the employment effects of services trade and investment reforms.},

We use data on shipments by 126 exporting countries to 59 importing countries in 5,000 product categories to answer the question: How? Do big economies export larger quantities of each good (the intensive margin), a wider set of goods (the extensive margin), or higher-quality goods? We find that the extensive margin accounts for around 60 percent of the greater exports of larger economies. Within categories, richer countries export higher quantities at modestly higher prices. We compare these findings to some workhorse trade models. Models with Armington national product differentiation have no extensive margin, and incorrectly predict lower prices for the exports of larger economies. Models with Krugman firm-level product differentiation do feature a prominent extensive margin, but overpredict the rate at which variety responds to exporter size. Models with quality differentiation, mean-while, can match the price },

We find evidence in support of Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2007), in that regions specializing in more sophisticated goods subsequently grow faster. We find substantial variation in export sophistication at the province and prefecture level, controlling for the level of development, and that this sophistication in turn drives growth. Our results suggest that these gains are limited to the ordinary export activities undertaken by domestic firms: no direct gains result from either processing trade activities or foreign firms, even though these are the main contributors to the global upgrading of China's exports. As such, the extent of assembly trade and foreign entities should be distinguished in order to measure the true movement in a country's technology and the contribution of exports to economic growth.},

  abstract  = { Although some economists remain skeptical of the existence of positive externalities associated with foreign direct investment (FDI), many countries spend large sums attracting foreign investors in the hope of benefiting from knowledge spillovers. Data collected through enterprise surveys conducted in the Czech Republic and Latvia suggest that the entry of multinationals affects domestic enterprises in the same industry or in upstream or downstream sectors through multiple channels. Some of these channels represent true knowledge spillovers while others have positive or negative effects on domestic producers in other ways. The relative magnitudes of these channels depend on host country conditions and the type of FDI inflows, which explains the seemingly inconsistent findings of the literature. The focus of the debate should shift from attempting to generalize about whether or not FDI leads to productivity spillovers to determining under what conditions it can do so.

In contrast with earlier literature that failed to find positive intraindustry spillovers from FDI, this study focuses on effects operating across industries. The analysis, based on firm-level data from Lithuania, produces evidence consistent with positive productivity spillovers from FDI taking place through contacts between foreign affiliates and their local suppliers in upstream sectors. The data indicate that spillovers are associated with projects with shared domestic and foreign ownership but not with fully owned foreign investments.},

To this end, a unique firm-level panel dataset is used with detailed information on foreign ownership at the firm level. Two main questions are addressed in the present paper: (1) do foreign firms perform better than their domestic counterparts? (2) do foreign firms generate spillovers to domestic firms? he estimation technique in this paper takes potential endogeneity of ownership, spillovers and other factors into account by estimating a fixed effects model using instrumental variables in the general methods of moment technique for panel data.},

  abstract  = {Standard economic analysis predicts that increased U.S. trade with unskilled labor-abundant countries should reduce the relative wages of U.S. unskilled labor, but empirical studies in the 1990s found only a modest effect. Has the situation changed in this decade, given the surge in imports from very low wage countries? In fact, most of this increase has been in skill-intensive goods such as computers, so that one would expect little additional impact on U.S. relative wages. However, developing countries appear to be specializing in unskilled labor—intensive niches within these industries. If so, the effect on wage inequality could still be significant. The paper develops a model and a numerical example showing that when developing countries can take over the unskilled labor—intensive portions of vertically specialized industries, the consequences can closely resemble the textbook effect. But determining the actual impact will require more finely disaggregated factor content data than},

The study also analyzes relevant provisions in the main labor law of each Eastern European and Central Asian (ECA) country associated with commencing or terminating employment and during the period of employment. References are made to relevant practices from EU15 countries. Overall, despite similar origin of country labor laws, the current set of labor regulations in the region provides a wide array of legal solutions. The minimum content of the employment contract in most ECA countries coincides, and goes beyond, the requirements of the labor standards even in the countries that are non-signatories of relevant treaties. Some of these entitlements, however, have the potential to adversely affect labor market participation.},

We find that higher labor market rigidity is associated with significantly higher levels of hysteresis.

In contrast with much of the recent literature, natural resource abundance appears to have a positive effect on growth, whereas export concentration hampers growth, even after controlling for physical and human capital accumulation, among other factors.},

We find that FDI flows are significantly higher in countries with relatively low unit labour costs. We also find that employment protection legislation does not exert a statistically significant impact on FDI flows. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that transition economies attract FDI via low production costs whereas indirect costs related to the rigidity of the labour market are less relevant.

It presents a model in which institutional differences play two roles: they create rents for some parties within the economy, and they are a source of comparative advantage in trade. Institutional quality is determined in a Grossman-Helpman type lobbying game. When countries share the same technology, there is a race to the top\&quot; in institutional quality: irrespective of country characteristics, both trade partners are forced to improve institutions after opening. On the other hand, domestic institutions will not improve in either trading partner when one of the countries has a strong enough technological comparative advantage in the good that relies on institutions. We test these predictions in a sample of 141 countries, by extending the geography-based methodology of Frankel and Romer (1999). Countries whose exogenous geographical characteristics predispose them to exporting in institutionally intensive sectors enjoy significantly higher institutional quality.},

Institutional differences are modeled within the Grossman-Hart-Moore framework of contract incompleteness. It is shown, among other things, that the less developed country may not gain from trade, and that factor prices may actually diverge as a result of trade. Second, the paper provides empirical evidence of ?institutional content of trade:? institutional differences are shown to be important determinant of trade flows.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a boosting method, multivariate L2Boosting, for multivariate linear regression based on some squared error loss for multivariate data. It can be applied to multivariate linear regression with continuous responses and to vector autoregressive time series. We prove, for i.i.d. as well as time series data, that multivariate L2Boosting can consistently recover sparse high-dimensional multivariate linear functions, even when the number of predictor variables pn and the dimension of the response qn grow almost exponentially with sample size n, pn = qn = O(exp(Cn1?)) (0 <  < 1, 0 < C < 1), but the `1-norm of the true underlying function is nite. Our theory seems to be among the rst to address the issue of large dimension of the response variable; the relevance of such settings is brie y outlined. We also identify empirically some cases where our multivariate L2Boosting is better than multiple application of univariate methods to single response components, thus demonstrating that the multivariate approach can be very useful.},

The goal of the review is to understand why every jurisdiction in the world has extensive employment law, particularly employment protection law, while most economic analysis of the law suggests that less employment protection would enhance welfare. The review has three parts. The first part discusses the structure of the common law and the evolution of employment protection law. The second part discusses the economic theory of contract. Finally, the empirical literature on employment and labor law is reviewed. I conclude that many aspects of employment law are consistent with the economic theory of contract - namely, that contracts are written and enforced to enhance ex ante match efficiency in the presence of asymmetric information and relationship specific investments. In contrast, empirical labor market research focuses upon ex post match efficiency in the face of an exogenous productivity shock. Hence, in order to understand the form and structure of existing employment law we need better empirical tools to assess the ex ante benefits of employment contracts.},

  Abstract                 = { Financial market imperfections severely restrict international trade flows because exporters require external capital. This article identifies and quantifies the three mechanisms through which credit constraints affect trade: the selection of heterogeneous firms into domestic production, the selection of domestic manufacturers into exporting, and the level of firm exports. I incorporate financial frictions into a heterogeneous-firm model and apply it to aggregate trade data for a large panel of countries. I establish causality by exploiting the variation in financial development across countries and the variation in financial vulnerability across sectors. About 20\%--25\% of the impact of credit constraints on trade is driven by reductions in total output. Of the additional, trade-specific effect, one-third reflects limited firm entry into exporting, while two-thirds are due to contractions in exporters' sales. Financially developed economies export more in financially vulnerable sectors because they enter more markets, ship more products to each destination, and sell more of each product. These results have important policy implications for less developed nations that rely on exports for economic growth but suffer from weak financial institutions.

  Abstract                 = {Numerous proposals have surfaced recently to incorporate a clause about labor standards in the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Such a clause would require each WTO member to recognize and enforce certain core labor standards: forbidding forced labor, discrimination, and the exploitation of child workers and guaranteeing the rights of workers to associate freely and engage in collective bargaining with employers. Failure to provide core labor standards would subject a country to international trade sanctions. Maskus analyzes links between core labor standards and international trade policy. He develops a series of simple models to see whether limiting core labor standards in export sectors of developing countries can improve the countries? price competitiveness in export markets. he concludes that deficient provision of core labor standards generally diminishes export competitiveness rather than improving it, because of the distortionary effects of those deficiencies. In other words, concerns about the negative impact on industrial countries of limited wage, employment, and labor standards in developing countries are largely misplaced ? with one exception: exploiting child labor could expand exports in highly labor-intensive sectors. But wage spillovers into industrial economy labor markets must be trivial, and there is no empirical evidence that the use of child labor provides measurable competitive advantages. Do international trade sanctions serve a legitimate, effective role in penalizing countries that fail to observe core labor standards? Maskus points out that trade restrictions are blunt, indirect instruments and may be counterproductive, harming the people they are designed to help and ineffective in achieving stated goals. Thus, including in WTO rules a social clause guaranteeing core labor standards would reduce global efficiency for a small gain. Some approaches ? including compensation programs from wealthy countries, focused on poverty reduction and better access to education ? would be more effective and less costly than trade restrictions. At the same time, the International Labor Organization could improve its monitoring and publicity efforts, to raise international consciousness about labor standards.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers a model of the world economy with a finite number of ex-ante identical countries and a continuum of tradeable goods. Productivity differences across countries arise endogenously through free entry to the local differentiated producer service sector in each country. It is shown that, in any stable equilibrium, the countries sort themselves into specializing in different sets of tradeable goods and that a strict ranking of countries in income, TFP, and the capital-labor ratio emerge endogenously. The equilibrium Lorenz curve is characterized by a second-order nonlinear difference equation with the two terminal conditions. As the number of countries increases, this equation converges to a differential equation whose unique solution can be solved analytically and depends on a few parameters in a tractable manner. This enables us to show when the equilibrium distribution obeys a power-law and how various forms of globalization affect inequality among countries and to study the welfare effects of trade.},

This article aims at analysing the impact of the level of transportation costs on the location choice of a monopolist. We consider two asymmetric regions. The heterogeneity of space lies in both regional incomes and population sizes: the first region is endowed with wide income spreads allocated among few consumers whereas the second one is highly populated however not as wealthy. Among the results, we show that a low transportation costs induces the firm to exploit size effects through locating in the most populated region. Moreover, a small transport cost decrease may induce a net welfare loss, thus allowing for regional development policies which do not rely on inter-regional transportation infrastructures. cost decrease may induce a net welfare loss, thus allowing for regional development policies which do not rely on inter-regional transportation infrastructures. [fre] Cet article développe une statique comparative de l'impact de différents scénarios d'investissement (projet d'infrastructure conduisant à une baisse modérée ou à une forte baisse du coût de transport inter-régional) sur le choix de localisation d'une entreprise en situation de monopole, au sein d'un espace intégré composé de deux régions aux populations et revenus hétérogènes. La première région, faiblement peuplée, présente de fortes disparités de revenus, tandis que la seconde, plus homogène en termes de revenu, représente un marché potentiel plus étendu. On montre que l'hétérogénéité des revenus constitue la force dominante du modèle lorsque le scénario d'investissement privilégié par les politiques publiques conduit à des gains substantiels du point de vue du coût de transport entre les deux régions. L'effet de richesse, lorsqu'il est associé à une forte disparité des revenus, n'incite pas l'entreprise à exploiter son pouvoir de marché au détriment de la région l},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate how the proximity to multinational exporters influences the creation of new export linkages (extensive margin of trade) by domestic firms in China. Using panel data from Chinese customs for 1997-2007, we show that domestic firms’ capacity to start exporting new varieties to new markets positively responds to the export activity of neighboring foreign firms for that same product-country pair. We find that foreign export spillovers are limited to ordinary trade activities. No foreign export spillovers are found for processing trade. More, export spillovers are stronger for sophisticated products indicating that proximity to foreign exporters may help domestic exporters to upgrade their exports. However we observe that foreign export spillovers are weaker when the technology gap between foreign and domestic firms is large, suggesting that upgrading may not occur when foreign firms have already a strong edge.},

It is observed that exports of manufactured goods are positively affected by the quality of institutions but neither total exports nor nonmanufactured exports. The latter may even correlate negatively with the quality of institutions. The results are robust to estimation methods. ( JEL F14, F15, O17) ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR },

  abstract    = {We construct a new linked data set with over one thousand offshoring events by matching Trade Adjustment Assistance program petition data to confidential data on U.S. firm operations. We exploit these data to assess how offshoring affects domestic firm-level aggregate employment, output, wages and productivity. Consistent with heterogenous firm models where offshoring involves a fixed cost, we find that the average offshoring firm is larger and more productive than the average non-offshorer. After initiating offshoring, firms experience large declines in employment (46.2 per cent), output (38.5 per cent) and capital (28.8 per cent) relative to their industry peers. We find no significant change in average wages or in total factor productivity measures for offshoring firms. These results are consistent across two separate difference-in-differences (DID) approaches, an instrumental variables approach, and a number of robustness checks. Thus, we find offshoring to be a strong substitute for domestic activity in this large sample of offshoring events.},

  Abstract                 = {What is the effect of an increase in the overall level of human capital on the economy of a city? Although much is known about the private return to education, much less is known about the more important question of what happens to productivity, wages and land prices when the aggregate stock of human capital in a city increases. Increases in the aggregate stock of human capital can benefit society in ways that are not fully reflected in the private return of education. Human capital spillovers can in theory increase aggregate productivity over and above the direct effect of human capital on individual productivity. Furthermore, increases in education can reduce criminal participation and improve voters' political behavior. In this chapter, I review what we know about social returns to education, with a particular emphasis on those externalities that accrue to local geographic areas. The focus of the chapter is on the empirical issues that arise in identifying these externalities and on the existing empirical evidence on their magnitude.},

  Abstract                 = { Many economic researchers have attempted to measure the effect of aggregate market or public policy variables on micro units by merging aggregate data with micro observations by industry, occupation, or geographical location, then using multiple regression or similar statistical models to measure the effect of the aggregate variable on the micro units. The methods are usually based upon the assumption of independent disturbances, which is typically not appropriate for data from populations with grouped structure. Incorrectly using ordinary least squares can lead to standard errors that are seriously biased downward. This note illustrates the danger of spurious regression from this kind of misspecification, using as an example a wage regression estimated on data for individual workers that includes in the specification aggregate regressors for characteristics of geographical states.

  Abstract                 = {Why do borders still matter for economic activity? The reunification of Germany in 1990 provides a unique natural experiment for examining the effect of political borders on trade. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the rapid formation of a political and economic union, strong and strictly enforced administrative barriers to trade between East Germany and West Germany were eliminated completely within a very short period of time. Remarkable persistence in intra-German trade patterns along the former East-West border suggests that border effects are neither statistical artefacts nor driven by administrative barriers to trade, but arise from economic fundamentals.},

  Abstract                 = {Barriers to international trade are known to be large. But have they become smaller over time? Building on the gravity framework by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), I derive an analytical solution for time-varying multilateral resistance variables that can be related to observable trade data. This solution makes it possible to infer time-varying bilateral trade costs directly from the model's gravity equation without imposing arbitrary trade cost functions. As an illustration, I show that U.S. trade costs with major trading partners declined on average by about 40 percent between 1970 and 2000, with Mexico and Canada experiencing the biggest reductions.},

Additionally, results demonstrated that contract enforcement explained more of a pattern of trade than physical capital or skilled labor. },

  Abstract                 = {Gomory and Baumol (2000), and Samuelson (2004) have raised concerns about international trade's future impact on U.S. national income. The focus is how globalization may affect the size and distribution across countries of gains from trade. Though their analysis is developed using a pure trade theoretical framework, it has strands in common with institutionalist thinking. Their findings spotlight the need for a new U.S. trade policy agenda aimed at maximizing the U.S. share of gains from trade, and complementing conventional Keynesian open economy macroeconomic analysis.http://bkstrm.epnet.com:8080/ai/images/spellCheck_over.gif Check Spelling [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In so doing we have strong predictions on the effect of immigrants on total exports, exports by category of goods, and on the extensive and intensive margin of trade. We test these predictions using the remarkable and uneven increase of immigration to Spanish provinces between 1993 and 2008. The richness of our data, a panel of import and export by sector between 50 Spanish provinces and 77 countries over fifteen years, allows us to control for a very large set of covariates and fixed effects and to use an instrumental variable strategy so that we can isolate the trade-creation effect of new immigrants. We are also able to qualify the effect of immigration on bilateral trade of homogeneous and differentiated goods, and its impact on the intensive and extensive margin of trade. Our findings support all the implications of the Chaney model showing that migration network indeed seems to decrease the fixed costs of trade. Finally by decomposing the effect across provinces and over time we find evidence that the elasticity of trade creation to new immigrant is larger once a critical mass has been reached.},

However, no direct gains emanate from the complexity of goods produced by either processing-trade activities or foreign firms. This suggests that the sources of product upgrading matter, and that domestic embeddedness is the key for capacity building and technology adoption to be growth enhancing.},

  Abstract                 = {A widespread concern is that labor market institutions erode in the course of globalization, which, in turn, decreases employment and wages. By using panel data and crosssectional data, I investigate the influence of globalization on labor market regulation. I use the indicators of labor market institutions by Gwartney et al. (2012) and the KOF indices of globalization. To deal with potential reverse causality, I employ a system GMM panel estimator and use a constructed trade share as proposed by Frankel and Romer (1999) as an instrumental variable for globalization in cross sectional models. The results do not show that globalization induced labor market deregulation.},

  Abstract                 = { Recently gravity trade models are applied to disaggregated trade data. Here many zeros are characteristic. In the presence of excess zeros usual Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) is still consistent, the variance covariance matrix however is invalid. Correct economic interpretation however requires also the last. So alternative estimators are looked for. Staub \& Winkelmann [2010] argue that zeroinflated count data models (i.e. zero-inflated Poisson / Negative Binomial Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (ZIPPML / ZINBPML)) are no alternative since under model misspecification these estimators are inconsistent. Yet zero-inflated Poisson Quasi- Likelihood (PQL) is a reliable alternative. It is consistent even under model misspecifications and beyond that robust against unobserved heterogeneity. Another alternative is a log-skew-normal Two-Part Model (G2PM) which generalizes the standard log-normal Two-Part Model (2PM). It is insofar advantageous as it adjusts for (negative) skewness and regression coefficients retain usual interpretations as in log-normal models. PQL is useful for multiplicative gravity model estimation and G2PM for log-linear gravity model estimation. Exemplarily the estimators are applied to intra-European piglet trade to assess their empirical performance and applicability for single commodity trade flow analysis. The empirical part favours PQL but G2PM is a reliable alternative for other trade flow analyses. PQL and G2PM should become standard tools for single commodity trade flow analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {French (2011) can analytically show that the standard Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) gravity trade model is only correctly specified for disaggregate data; gravity trade model analysis should be done at product level and then estimation results should be reaggregated. If however gravity trade model analysis is to be done at product level then also estimation issues in disaggregate gravity trade models should come to the fore. As is shown, previous estimators suffer under different statistical problems. This paper proposes a zero-in ated Poisson Quasi-Likelihood (PQL) and a Gamma Two-Part Model (G2PM) as reliable alternatives. Estimated within a Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) framework, both estimators are consistent and have more or less conservative test statistics. Further, for model selection a Quasi-Likelihood under the Independence Model Criterion (QIC) is recommend since this statistic is conform with GEE approaches. Both estimators PQL and G2PM and the model selection technique QIC should become standard tools for disaggregate gravity trade model estimation. --},

One is inclined to believe so based on countless industry-level studies and the many political battles that are continually fought over trade and industrial policy. In contrast, standard neoclassical trade theory suggests that industrial structure is primarily driven by relative factor supplies. This paper demonstrates that aggregate factor endowments explain much of the structure of production?independent of industry idiosyncrasies?and quantifies the extent to which shifts in industrial structure in a cross-section of countries are driven by the broad forces of factor accumulation. These results are reached through an empirical application of the factor proportions model of production.},

  Abstract                 = {The empirical effects of different measures of labour standards on the export performance of the United States are analysed using annual data for the period 1950-1998, applying a time series approach based on the structural change literature. Hence, a model with endogenous breaks is estimated following the methodology proposed by Bai and Perron (Econometrica, 66, 47-78, 1998). The results show that the labour standards, represented by the number of hours worked, the rate of occupational injuries and the unionization rate, are all very important to explain the behaviour of exports for the United States. In particular, it is found that low labour standards may both improve or lead to a deterioration in export performance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

It is shown that the linkage effect of multinationals on the host country is more likely to be favorable when the good that multinationals produce uses intermediate goods intensively, when there are large costs of communication between the headquarters and the production plant, and when the home and host countries are not too different in terms of the variety of intermediate goods produced. If these conditions are reversed, then multinationals could even hurt the developing economy, formalizing the idea that multinationals may create enclave economies within developing countries.

We analyze the equilibrium specialization and trade patterns for different levels of transport costs and externality parameters. Understanding trade via the distribution of economic activity in space naturally rationalizes the evidence on border effects and the "gravity equation."

  Abstract                 = {The article presents a seminal work of Robert Barro, the recent empirical literature on economic growth has identified a substantial number of variables that are partially correlated with the rate of economic growth. It debates if one is interested in knowing the coefficient of a particular variable in a growth regression, the picture emerging from the empirical growth literature is not the pessimistic "nothing is robust" obtained with the extreme bound analysis. Instead, a substantial number of variables can be found to be strongly related to growth. The problem faced by empirical growth economists is that growth theories are not explicit enough about what variables "x" belong in the "true" regression. One possible reason for finding few or no robust variables is, of course, that very few variables can be identified to be correlated systematically with growth. he reason for using this weighting scheme is to give more weight to the regressions or models that are more likely to be the },

The intuition is that, on average, the industries that use a given factor heavily have positive output responses, following an increase in the endowment of this factor. This co-variation condition is robust to Hicks neutral- and factor-augmenting productivity differences, and constitutes a direct test of the production side of the factor proportions theory. We also show that the co-variation condition finds empirical support. This is evidence that is consistent with the factor proportions theory.},

The presence of foreign firms has a positive spillover effect on labour productivity of local firms in the same sector, specifically in very open manufacturing sectors. Spillover effects between sectors are found to be relatively more important than spillover effects within sectors. Foreign investment in user sectors has a positive spillover effect on local suppliers, while the opposite holds for foreign investment in supplier sectors. Absorption and openness play a significant role in these spillover effects.},

Results also reveal that industry-level data hide substantial intra-industry heterogeneity, violating the assumptions of the model and complicating the interpretation of results from earlier research. A methodology for adjusting industry output to reflect underlying product variation is introduced. Reestimation of the model using adjusted aggregates in place of standard industry classifications provides strong support for Heckscher-Ohlin specialization.},

  Abstract                 = {Involuntary unemployment appears to be a persistent feature of many modem labor markets. The presence of such unemployment raises the question of why wages do not fall to clear labor markets. In this paper, authors show how the information structure of employer-employee relationships, in particular the inability of employers to costlessly observe workers' on-the-job effort, can explain involuntary unemployment as an equilibrium phenomenon. The authors also show that imperfect monitoring necessitates unemployment in equilibrium. Under the conventional competitive paradigm, in which all workers receive the market wage and there is no unemployment, the worst that can happen to a worker who shirks on the job is that he is fired. Since he can immediately be rehired, however, he pays no penalty for his misdemeanor. With imperfect monitoring and full employment, therefore, workers will choose to shirk. To induce its workers not to shirk, the firm attempts to pay more than the "going wage"; t},

  Abstract                 = {Although economists have long been aware of Jensen's inequality, many econometric applications have neglected an important implication of it: the standard practice of interpreting the parameters of log-linearized models estimated by ordinary least squares as elasticities can be highly misleading in the presence of heteroskedasticity. This paper explains why this problem arises and proposes an appropriate estimator. Our criticism to conventional practices and the solution we propose extends to a broad range of economic applications where the equation under study is log-linearized. We develop the argument using one particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade, and apply the proposed technique to provide new estimates of this equation. We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method. These discrepancies persist even when the gravity equation takes into account multilateral resistance terms or fixed effects},

We survey the theoretical literature on international labor standards, and give an overview of the analytical framework and main arguments provided in this literature. Among the situations in which a case for labor standards may arise are imperfections in labor markets, market power effects in international trade, and concerns that consumers, or individuals in general, may have about the working conditions or rights that other individuals enjoy. We emphasize the importance of making clear the value judgments being used, and discuss the different institutional issues that may arise in considering the implementation of labor standards. In general, while there are contexts in which promoting labor standards through some form of collective action is beneficial, we argue that such policies ought to be incorporated into a broader perspective on well-being, and a package of policies that can promote the well-being of the poor.},

  Abstract                 = {Do openness to trade and higher levels of human capital growth promote faster growth? To answer that question we use a panel of countries to investigate the role of human capital and two measures of openness in determining both the level of income and its growth rate. We argue that focusing on the levels of income by estimating a production function will give misleading estimates if there are unobserved differences in the underlying growth of technical efficiency across countries that are correlated with the explanatory variables. Using a growth rate equation, where we allow for country fixed effects and for possible endogeneity of explanatory variables, we show that both measures of openness, one the Sachs-Warner measure which reflects policy, and one from the PENN World Tables, the share of trade in GDP, give similar results. We argue that openness has a highly significant and large effect on the underlying rate of growth of productivity, while human capital does not.},

  Abstract                 = {This policy brief takes the position that international labor standards should not be incorporated into the WTO and other trade agreements as we argue that this will not achieve either of the two professed goals: a) improving the wages and working conditions of workers in poor countries and b) keeping more jobs in the industrialized countries. In fact, empirical evidence shows that such mandates can reduce the number of workers with better working conditions and increase the number in poorer conditions, hence creating further inequality. The literature also shows that low labor standards do not provide developing countries with an unfair advantage in their export trade nor do they drive FDI. We recommend alternative policies be deployed through existing institutions. For the poor countries, sustainable improvement of the wages and working conditions of workers can only be achieved through solid economic and social development policies, deployed with the assistance of international organizations (regional banks, NGOs, etc). For the industrialized countries, we recommend that more effort be focused on preparing workers to be able to adapt to the evolving global economy. The process of economic change is complex and cannot be managed by mandates. The alternative policies we propose will be far more effective in making workers and the economies better off.},

The impact has, however, been uneven. This, in many ways, is consistent with theoretical models of the GATT/WTO. The theory suggests that the impact of a country's membership in the GATT/WTO depends on what the country does with its membership, with whom it negotiates, and which products the negotiation covers. Using a properly specified gravity model, we find evidence broadly consistent with these predictions. First, industrial countries that participated more actively than developing countries in reciprocal trade negotiations witnessed a large increase in trade. Second, bilateral trade was greater when both partners undertook liberalization than when only one partner did. Third, sectors that did not witness liberalization did not see an increase in trade.

  Abstract                 = {Human capital is unequally distributed across cities or regions within a country. The way how the spatial distribution of human capital evolves over time sheds light on the strength of concentration forces for high-skilled workers, such as localised increasing returns to human capital. In this paper I analyse the impact of human capital on local employment growth for Western German regions (1977–2006). Two main empirical facts are established: “Skilled cities” inWestern Germany grow faster. At the same time there is convergence of human capital shares across cities, i.e., high-skilledworkers do not increasingly concentrate in space.Whereas the first fact (the “smart city hypothesis”) similarly holds in Germany and in the US, there is a striking difference when it comes to the second fact. Some researchers have found an opposite trend of human capital divergence across US metropolitan areas. My findings suggest that human capital exhibits a different spatial trend in different countries. I present a theoretical model which shows that the spatial convergence trend does not imply that concentration forces for high-skilled workers are absent inWestern Germany, but only that they are relatively weak compared to countervailing dispersion forces. I further discuss some reasons that may explain the differences between Western Germany and the US. I emphasise the role of the tax system and the impact of pro-dispersive regional policy in Europe.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper re-explores the relation between a country's level of wealth and the mix of products it exports. We argue that both are simultaneously determined by countries' capabilities i.e. by countries' productivity and quality levels for each good. Our theoretical setup has two features. (1) Some goods have fewer high-quality producers/countries than others i.e. there is Ricardian comparative advantage. (2) Imperfect competition allows high- and low-quality producers to coexist, which we refer to as 'product ranges'. These two features generate a very particular non-monotonic, general equilibrium relationship between a country's export mix and its wage (GDP per capita). We show that this non-monotonicity permeates the 1980-2005 International data on trade and GDP per capita. Our setup also explains two other facets of the data: (1) Product ranges are huge and (2) for the poorest third of countries, changes in export mix substantially over-predict growth in GDP per capita. This suggests that the main challenge for low-income countries is to raise quality and productivity in their existing product lines.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies how a country's labor market institutions, by affecting workers' skill acquisition, can shape its export patterns. I develop an open-economy model in which workers undertake non-contractible activities to acquire firm-specific skills on the job. In the model, labor market protection raises workers' incentives to acquire firm-specific skills relative to general skills, turning labor laws into a source of comparative advantage. In particular, the model shows that countries with more protective labor laws export relatively more in firm-specific skill-intensive sectors at both the intensive and extensive margins. To test the theoretical predictions, I construct sector proxies for the firm-specific and industry-specific skill intensity by estimating returns to firm tenure and industry tenure for different U.S. manufacturing sectors during the 1974–1993 period. By estimating sector-level gravity equations for 84 countries using the Helpman–Melitz–Rubinstein (2008) framework, I find evidence supporting the predicted effects of labor market institutions at both margins of exports.},

  Abstract                 = { In contrast to cross-country studies, the paper investigates the relationships between trade and labour productivity for nine rapidly developing Asian countries in a time-series framework using a vector error-correction model. Independent tests on the long-run and short-run relationship between trade variables of exports and imports and productivity are conducted. The results suggest that trade has an important impact on productivity and output growth in the economy, however it is imports that provide the important 'virtuous' link between trade and output growth. The results indicate that exports and imports have qualitatively different impacts on labour productivity. The long-run result shows that there is no causal effect from exports to labour productivity growth for Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand; thereby suggesting that there is no export-led productivity growth in these countries. However, significant causal effects were found from imports to productivity growth, suggesting import-led productivity growth in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan. In addition, the results indicate that imports tend to have greater positive impact on productivity growth in the long run.},

The analysis shows that differences in labor market flexibility between countries affect their competitive positions in international markets and can serve as independent cause of international trade. it is argued that an increase in labor market flexibility may change the relative price of goods within the country making it more competitive in international markets for the commodities with uncertain demand. changes in relative prices can alter countries’ comparative advantage and thus international trade patterns. furthermore, it is shown that due to the differences in relative prices resulting from different labor market regulations, international trade between countries can be observed even if the countries are identical in all respects (e.g., labor productivity and production technology). data reveal that a country with more a flexible labor market has a comparative advantage in, and tends to export, goods with more variable demand (e.g., fashionable cloths, seasonal toys), while a country with a more rigid labor market has a comparative advantage in, and tends to export, commodities with more stable demand.},

  Abstract                 = {Zahlreiche Untersuchungen belegen, dass die exportierenden Firmen den nur für den Inlandsmarkt produzierenden Firmen in vieler Hinsicht überlegen sind – sie sind im Durchschnitt größer, produktiver und innovativer, und sie waren dies schon, bevor sie mit dem Export begonnen haben. Eine offene Frage ist, wie und in welchem Maße die Firmen dann vom Export profitieren. Ökonometrische Auswertungen auch der Basis von Längsschnittdaten von Firmen zeigen nur selten positive Auswirkungen der Exportaktivitäten. Dies kann auch an den hierbei verwendeten Methoden liegen, denn ein Vergleich der exportierenden Firmen mit sich selbst in einer Situation ohne Export ist ja nicht möglich. Eine direkte Befragung von Exporteuren kann hier neue Erkenntnisse bringen. Eine Befragung von exportierenden Firmen aus den IHK-Bezirken Lüneburg- Wolfsburg und Stade zeigt, dass die Firmen sehr heterogen sind – nicht alle profitieren in gleicher Weise und in gleichem Maße vom Export. Große positive Effekte finden sich bei mehr als der Hälfte der Firmen bezogen auf Wachstum, Kapazitätsauslastung und Erträge sowie bei rund 40 Prozent mit Bezug auf den Ausgleich inländischer Konjunkturschwankungen. Umgekehrt sieht es bei den „Lerneffekten“ (Anregungen von Auslandskunden zur Verbesserung der Produkte; Steigerung der Produktivität als Reaktion auf höheren Wettbewerbsdruck auf Auslandsmärkten; bessere Einschätzung der eigenen Konkurrenzfähigkeit aufgrund von Kontakten mit Konkurrenten auf Auslandsmärkten und daraus folgende entsprechende Reaktionen) aus – hier überwiegen deutlich die Angaben wonach keine oder allenfalls geringe Effekte vorliegen. Was erklärt die in der Befragung festgestellten Unterschiede zwischen den Firmen in Bezug auf die Auswirkungen der Exporttätigkeit? Als zentrales Ergebnis können wir festhalten, dass bis auf den Exportanteil am Umsatz keine der anderen betrachteten Firmeneigenschaften wie Größe, Dauer der Exporterfahrung, Forschungs- und Entwicklungstätigkeit oder Auslandsniederlassungen ausschlaggebend dafür sind, ob eine Firma vom Export in verschiedener Hinsicht positiv beeinflusst wird oder nicht. Vom Export können also sehr unterschiedliche Firmen gleichermaßen profitieren, wobei tendenziell die Wahrscheinlichkeit dafür, dass ein starker positiver Effekt zu beobachten ist, mit zunehmendem Anteil des Auslandsumsatzes am Umsatz ansteigt. Simulationsrechnungen mit den geschätzten Modellen zeigen hierbei: Wenn es Effekte des Exports gibt, dann werden diese in der Regel erst ab einem Exportanteil am Umsatz von mindestens 25 Prozent deutlich.},

  Abstract                 = {Employment protection (EPL) has a well known negative impact on labor flows as well as an ambiguous but often negative effect on employment. In contrast, its impact on capital accumulation and capital-labor ratio is less well understood. The available empirical evidence suggests a non-monotonic relation between capital-labor ratios and EPL: positive at very low levels of EPL, and then negative. We explore the theoretical effects of EPL on physical capital in a model of a firm facing labor frictions. Under standard assumptions, theory always implies a motononic negative link between capital-labor ratios and EPL. For a positive link to arise, a very specific pattern of complementarity between capital and workers protected by EPL(senior workers, as opposed to unprotected new entrants, or junior workers) has to be assumed. Further, no standard production technology is able to reproduce the inverted U-shape pattern of the data. Instead, endogenous specific skills investment leads to an inverted U-shape pattern: EPL protects and therefore induces investments in specific skills. We develop such a model and calibrate the returns to seniority by using estimates from the empiricalliterature. Under complementarity between capital and specific human capital, physical capital and senior workers having accumulated specific human capital are de facto complement production factors and EPL may increase capital demand at the firm level. The paper concludes that labor market institutions may sometimes favor physical and human capital investments in second-best environments.},

  abstract  = {Recent studies have found that China is \&quot;special\&quot; in exporting highly sophisticated goods not comparable with its income level. In this paper we identify two measurement biases that account for this \&quot;China is special\&quot; observation. First, product quality has not been fully considered in the measurement of sophistication, which has caused an overestimation of the sophistication of China's exports. Second, the average income of China has been used to measure the export capability of China, which has caused an underestimation of China's capability of exporting sophisticated goods. After correcting the two measurement biases, China appears much less as an outlier in the cross-country comparison of the sophistication of exports.},

While some believe that this trend is a result of processing trade and foreign direct investment, the evidence is mixed. This paper examines variations in level of export sophistication across China's manufacturing industries. We find that an industry's level of export sophistication is positively related to the share of wholly foreign owned enterprises from OECD countries and the share of processing exports of foreign-invested enterprises, and negatively related to the share of processing exports of indigenous Chinese enterprises. Evidence from the relative export prices of Chinese goods, which measure within-product export sophistication, shows a similar pattern.},

  Abstract                 = {The growth in world trade during the last decades was largely caused by increasing bilateral exchanges of parts and components as a consequence of international fragmentation of production. Apparently, the international integration of the Newly Industrializing and Eastern European economies prompted firms in ‘high-wage’ countries to exploit factor price differences in order to increase their international competitiveness. However, theory predicts that, beside factor price differences, international fragmentation of production should be driven by a multitude of additional determinants. Against this background, the present paper reveals empirical evidence on parts and components trade as an indicator for international fragmentation of production in the European Union and determines its main explanatory factors. The results of a panel data analysis show that especially industry specific factors as well as communication and transportation infrastructure are likewise important for shifting production to or sourcing components from foreign countries.},

The starting point is the international incidence of productivity frictions inferred from gravity. Sellers? and buyers? incidence both reduce real income. Sellers? incidence shocks reduce sectoral skill premia. Bigger sellers? incidence by country (sector) reduces equilibrium shares of world (national) GDP. In contrast to the generalized Ricardian gravity model of Eaton and Kortum (2002), relative factor endowments play a role and import-competing production and wage premia in exporting are featured.},

  abstract    = {The paper explores the evolution of export diversification patterns along the economic development path. Using a large database with 156 countries over 19 years at the HS6 level of disaggregation (4’991 product lines) we look for action at the “intensive” and “extensive” margins (diversification of export values among active product lines and by addition of new product lines respectively) using various export concentration indices and the number of active export lines. We also look at new product introduction as an indicator of “export-entrepreneurship”. We find a hump-shaped pattern of export diversification similar to what Imbs and Wacziarg (2003) found for production and employment. Diversification and subsequent re-concentration take place mostly along the extensive margin, although the intensive margin follows the same pattern. This hump-shaped pattern is consistent with the conjecture that countries travel across diversification cones, as discussed in Schott (2003, 2004) and Xiang (2007).},

We consider a world economy with an arbitrary number of countries, one factor of production, a continuum of intermediate goods, and one final good. Production of the final good is sequential and subject to mistakes. In the unique free trade equilibrium, countries with lower probabilities of making mistakes at all stages specialize in later stages of production. Because of the sequential nature of production, absolute productivity differences are a source of comparative advantage among nations. Using this simple theoretical framework, we offer a first look at how vertical specialization shapes the interdependence of nations.},

To this end, I use micro data of Slovenian manufacturing firms operating in the period 1994–2000. Overall I find that export entrants become more productive once they start exporting. The productivity gap between exporters and their domestic counterparts increases further over time. These results also hold at the industry level and are robust to other controls that may be associated with increased productivity, such as private ownership. Using information on the (firm-level) destination of exports, I find that the productivity gains are higher for firms exporting towards high income regions.},

  abstract  = {A HUGE and emerging literature on the microeconometrics of international trade demonstrates that exporting firms are more productive than otherwise identical firms that sell on the national market only (see Bernard et al., 2007, for the US; Mayer and Ottaviano, 2007, for European countries; Wagner, 2007a, for a survey of studies from countries all over the world; and ISGEP, 2008, for strictly comparable results from 14 countries). Exporting firms have to bear extra costs due to, among others, market research, adaptation of products to local regulations, or transport costs. These extra costs are one reason for a self-selection of the more productive firms on international markets. Furthermore, exporting firms tend to pay higher wages than non-exporting firms (see Schank et al., 2007, for a survey). Germany, one of the leading actors on the world market for goods, is a case in point: after controlling for observable and unobservable firm characteristics, productivity is significantly and substantially higher in exporting than in non-exporting firms (Wagner, 2007b), and compared to identical non-exporting firms exporting firms pay significantly and substantially higher wages to workers with the same observable and unobservable characteristics (Schank et al., 2007).},

We question this diagnosis using three lines of argument. First, effective restructuring of the supply side in the core advanced industries was carried out by the private sector using institutions of the coordinated economy, including unions, works councils and blockholder owners. Second, the implementation of orthodox labour market and welfare state reforms created a flexible labour market at the lower end. Third, low growth and high unemployment are largely accounted for by the persistent weakness of domestic aggregate demand, rather than by the failure to reform the supply side. Strong growth in recent years reflects the successful restructuring of the core economy. To explain these developments, we identify the external pressures on companies in the context of increased global competition, the continuing value of the institutions of the coordinated market economy to the private sector and the constraints imposed on the use of stabilizing macroeconomic policy by these institutions. We also suggest how changes in political coalitions allowed orthodox labour market reforms to be implemented in a consensus political system.},

Exports of more \&quot;sophisticated\&quot; products appear to be positively correlated with growth, and upgrading the quality of exports is high on the policy agenda of many countries. This study presents evidence suggesting that attracting inflows of FDI offers potential for raising the quality of exports in developing countries. Our empirical analysis relates unit values of exports measured at the 4-digit SITC level to data on sectors treated by investment promotion agencies as priority in their efforts to attract FDI. The sample covers 105 countries over the period 1984-2000. The findings are consistent with a positive effect of FDI on unit values of exports in developing countries. The evidence for high income economies is ambiguous. When we examine the link between FDI and the overlap between the export structure of developing and high income economies (\&quot;export sophistication\&quot;), we find no evidence of FDI increasing the similarity of export structure between the two groups.},

We confirm Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2007)’s prediction that regions that engage in the cost discovery process of developing sophisticated goods grasp greater gains from globalization and grow faster. We find that these gains are limited to to export activities undertaken by domestic entities. Direct gains do not appear to derive from foreign entities typically engaged in processing trade even though they are the main contributors to the global upgrading of China’s exports. Our findings globally suggest that the expected gains from exporting higher productivity goods are not unconditional, they are greater for provinces already blessed by high incomes, better market centrality and higher trade performance and Foreign Direct Investment attractiveness. These features consistent with evidence of increasing returns to sophistication are unfortunately likely to contribute further to the current widening of spatial economic disparities across China.},

Intermediate usage creates cost and demand linkages between firms and a tendency for manufacturing agglomeration. How does globalization affect the location of manufacturing and the gains from trade? At high transport costs all countries have some manufacturing industry, but when transport costs fall below a critical value a core-periphery pattern forms spontaneously, and nations that find themselves in the periphery suffer a decline in real income. As transport costs continue to fall there comes a second stage of convergence in real incomes, in which the peripheral nations gain and the core nations may well lose.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

However, being computed on observed trade flows, it mixes up all the factors influencing trade flows. In particular, Balassa Index cannot isolate exporter-sector (ex ante) specific factors which are the source of comparative advantage in the spirit of the traditional trade model. Furthermore, Balassa Index suffers some empirical distribution weaknesses, mainly time instability and poor ordinal ranking property (Yeats 1985; Hinloopen and Van Marrewijk 2001). A recent paper by Costinot et al. (2012) provides a micro-founded version of the Ricardian model and suggests a new measure for comparative advantage. We build up on this paper, and present a dataset providing a new econometric based measure for Ricardian RCA.},

The direct factor requirements can quite easily be computed at a disaggregated industry level, such as the four-digit standard industrial classification (SIC), as in Katz and Murphy (1992). This is not true, however, for the indirect factor requirements, which require the use of an input-output matrix for the economy. The authors attempt to show that the difference between the domestic output and net exports weighting scheme leads to a systematic bias in the factor content of trade. Furthermore, the sign of this bias is the same as that obtained from a regression of net exports on factor contents, similar to that performed by Robert Baldwin (1971). The authors apply this expression of the aggregation bias to the measurement of the factor-content trade in US manufacturing.},

Agricultural trade among Italy and China has been limited to secondary products, especially originated in the livestock sector. However, in the last decade exchanges have been constantly increasing and the set of products changing deeply. Specifically, Italian exports to China have been specialising towards the typical \&quot;Made in Italy\&quot; processed products, showing a potential market for Italian agricultural and food products. In order to test the opportunity and the risks of the integration of China into the world agro-food markets, some similarity indices have been calculated, with refer to two different markets: the EU-15 and the Chinese market. In the first case the similarity of Chinese exports with those of some EU partners on the EU-15 market was considered; in the second the similarity of exports of some EU Member States to China was calculated. Taking into account the different level of quality of agro-food products, the main result of the analysis is that Chinese products entering EU are more complementary than similar to the EU products; at the same time, China is a great potential market for EU products, and Italy will compete with other EU countries in the gain of quotas on the Chinese agro-food market.},

  abstract    = { The paper analyses the trade relationships among EU- 15 members and some emerging partners: the NMS, Turkey and China. The EU enlargement to 10 countries has modified quite remarkably the features of agri-food trade in Europe. Some of the NMS, such as Poland, Hungary and the Check Republic, contribute to a large extent to the international agri-food trade and, since the beginning of the process of EU accession, have modified dramatically the exchanges with the EU- 15. More recently, other countries are facing new relationships with the EU: Turkey and China. Turkey is a large Mediterranean country and, as a candidate to the EU accession, enjoys a differential treatment in the agri- food trade relationships with the EU. China can be considered as a new international competitor, growing at faster pace after having joined the WTO and increasing its agri-food trade exchanges with the EU. The analysis will focus on the measurement of the similarity of agri-food exports of Italy and other EU-15 member States with the new partners to the EU- 15 market. It will be carried out with the support of three different indicators: the export structure similarity index (ES), the product similarity index (PSI) and the quality similarity index (QSI), using the Eurostat database with an eight \&quot;digit\&quot; merchandise disaggregation and with reference only to agri-food exchanges. It can be concluded that the similarity is quite low, especially if compared to that of the exports of the EU- 15 countries to the EU market. Moreover, looking at the level of quality of export products, it is highlighted how quality remains a crucial factor for Italian and European agri- food products to compete with external products.

Export and import data are used as the criteria for determining bilateral trade between major trade partners, resulting in the creation of 127 pairs of countries on the basis of export data and 134 pairs on the basis of import data. An increase in trade between major trade partners - and in particular, increased exports by poorer countries to their wealthier partners - is shown to be related to an increase in the rate of convergence between the countries.},

We evaluate the appropriateness of different classes of similarity indices, using rank correlation index and two distance metrics, the Euclidean index and the Bray-Curtis index. We examine the evolution of similarity along time - from 1989 to 2000 - considering both self-similarity (how the export structure of a EU member-to-be has changed with respect to the beginning of the transition process) and EU-similarity (if and how the export structure of a EU member-to-be has changed with respect to the EU export structure). Finally, we examine how the process of integration with the EU and its reflection in the increased relevance of processed trade influenced the CEECs’ current pattern of specialization.},

  abstract    = {The question addressed in this paper is whether the gap in performance between the developed and developing worlds can continue, and in particular, whether developing nations can sustain the rapid growth they have experienced of late. The good news is that growth in the developing world should depend not on growth in the advanced economies themselves, but on the difference in the productivity levels of the two groups of countries - on the "convergence gap" - which remains quite large. Yet much of this convergence potential is likely to go to waste. Convergence is anything but automatic, and depends on sustaining rapid structural change in the direction of tradables such as manufacturing and modern services. The policies that successful countries have used to achieve this are hard to emulate. Moreover, these policies - such as currency undervaluation and industrial policies - will meet greater resistance on the part of industrial countries struggling with stagnant economies and high unemployment.},

In our extension of the theoretical framework of Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2005) with heterogeneous firms we discuss the influence of economic fundamentals and trade cost on extensive and intensive margins of trade. Then, we use gravity model of trade to calculate potentials for CEECs trade with EU-15 countries. As a result, we develop convergence measures for CEECs exports and imports trade flows with EU-15. Moreover, we provide decomposition of trade flows on extensive and intensive margins, and construct convergence measures for each of the trade components. Finally, we analyze the mechanics of trade convergence process in selected CEECs. Current paper contributes to better understanding of trade convergence patterns in European transition countries, providing policy-makers in transition economies with useful insights on the role of different trade components in the convergence process.},

The current paper is in the tradition of this literature but develops two new strands. First, it examines the exports-growth link in a dynamic fashion, providing a more rigorous approach than has been attempted previously. Second it explores the role of export composition in determining growth performance. By constructing a panel of 69 countries and using the dynamic model, the results generated suggest that there is a strong positive relationship between exports and growth. Further, it is apparent that the composition of those exports is important in determining the strength of growth.},

Different theories offer conflicting predictions regarding how they might affect each other. In the existing empirical literature estimating the trade impact on income convergence, a long-lasting problem is the reverse causality from income convergence to trade. This paper provides a disaggregated bilateral trade data analysis to solve this problem. The results show that the reverse causality from income convergence to trade exists in differentiated product sectors, but not in homogeneous product sectors. Trade in homogeneous sectors reduces the income gaps among trade partners, but it is not significantly affected by their income difference. Therefore, the negative effect of trade in homogeneous sectors on the income gap is free from the reverse causality problem. It can be taken as a pure evidence of trade-induced income convergence. This result is robust to various econometric methods.},

I define a global unbalanced growth path as a situation in which there exists a global constant return to capital. I use this definition to explore two claims regarding the sectoral composition of trade between primaries and non-primaries. First, in the long run, the comparative advantage in one good or the other is driven by the TFP differential in both sectors, which explains the fact that less developed countries tend to export primaries even though primaries are not less capital intensive. Second, non-homothetic preferences imply that, as the global economy develops, fewer and fewer countries export only or mostly primaries. (Copyright: Elsevier)},

This indicates that the qualities of exports from the observed transitional economies have not rapidly improved, and the export structure remains relatively unfavourable, particularly when compared to advanced transitional countries. The most important factors in the success of advanced transitional economies were: the inflow of foreign direct investment, imports of modern technology (and later, their own development), innovation, development of small and medium sized enterprises, foreign competition, the development of a market economy and macroeconomic stability. The export structures of Romania, Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia correlate with improvement in the process of transition in the observed countries. In 2009 Bosnia had the absolute lowest level of similarity coefficient among the studied countries, followed by Serbia, Romania and Croatia, which corresponds to the overall economic performance and foreign trade of the observed economies.},

Based on the structure developed by Feder (1983) and Crespo-Cuaresma and Wörz (2005), we develop a panel data model involving Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, member countries of the Andean Community (except Venezuela since 2011), during 1970-2009. The analysis was made for the countries both jointly and individually using the SURE method, then focusing on the degree of disaggregation of exports, and finally grouping exports according to the level of technological intensity. The results suggest that the influence of the export structure is different across countries and is divided between different types of exports; but the majority of the exports that affect positively and significantly economic growth in the Andean Community countries correspond to the manufacturing industry and high technology, and they do so via externality effect},

They exploit data on personal income since 1840 and on gross state product since 1963. The U.S. states provide clear evidence of convergence, but the findings can be reconciled quantitatively with the neoclassical model only if diminishing returns to capital set in very slowly.

Frankel and Romer recently use a country's geographic attributes - notably its distance from potential trading partners - as an instrument to identify the effects of trade on income in 1985. Using data from the pre- World War I, the interwar, and the post-war periods, this paper finds that the Frankel-Romer result is robust to different time periods, i.e., that instrumenting for trade with geographic characteristics raises the estimated positive effect of trade on income by a substantial margin and, in most of our cases, the precision of those estimates. These results suggest that the downward bias of OLS estimates is systematic and may be due to measurement error, a potential source of which is that trade is an imperfect proxy for a host of economically beneficial interactions between countries. However, the results are not robust to the inclusion of another geographic variable, latitude (distance from the equator).<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

In a GMM dynamic panel estimation for the period 1975-2005, though it is found that diversification and composition of exports have significant impacts on economic growth in both the regions, diversification within the manufacturing sector is important for Asia only. The common determinants of growth in the two regions are exports, investment, public debt and human capital. On the other hand, the differentiating factors on the diverging growth experiences of Asia and Latin America are infrastructure, regional integration and institutional aspects like patent protection, and WTO.},

Recent literature also indicates the importance of export sophistication on economic development. This raises an important question whether export sophistication contributes to the income improvement in sub-Saharan African. The paper examines the causal effect of export sophistication on income in sub-Saharan Africa with panel data. By employing instrumental variables techniques and heteroskedasticity identification strategy that correct for endogeneity bias, the findings show that within-country variations in export sophistication lead to income growth. That is, a 1 {\%} point increase in the export sophistication index is associated with an increase in GDP per capita of approximately 0.08 {\%} points in the long run.},

We analyze the sectoral export patterns of the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) by comparing them to those of the current members of the European Union (EU), focusing on countries' specialization as suppliers for the EU market, and we assess whether similar export patterns foster the catching-up process of the CEECs. Our main result is that similarity in export composition has a positive, significant and non-linear impact on catching-up, and seems to be driven by the growth of the main export market and delocalization of production more than by other factors.

We find that there is a positive spillover effect of growth from one country to its trade partners. The implied rate of convergence is higher after including the spatial terms.},

Different studies have shown these disparities between growth rates largely to have been caused by different rates of increase in productivity per unit of factor input.

The paper explores the causal relationship between productivity and exports based on Austrian data using time series analysis. The causality analysis indicates no causal link from exports to productivity while the null of no causality from productivity to exports has to be rejected at conventional levels.},

  abstract  = { \&quot;China's exports have grown dramatically over the last three decades in large part due to its rapid penetration of new product markets. To help address the implications of this growth for developed economies, this paper gauges the relative sophistication of Chinese exports along two dimensions. First, I measure China's export overlap with developed countries by comparing the set of products China exports to the United States with the bundle of products exported by the OECD. Second, I compare Chinese and other countries' exports within product markets in terms of the price they receive in the US market. While China's export overlap with the OECD is much greater than one would predict given its low wages, the prices that US consumers are willing to pay for China's exports are substantially lower than the prices they are willing to pay for OECD exports. This fact, as well as the increase in the 'OECD premium' over time, suggests that competition between China and the world's most developed economies may be less direct than their product-mix overlap implies. It may also reflect efforts by developed-country firms to compete with China by dropping their least sophisticated offerings and moving up the quality ladder\&quot;.

  abstract    = {This paper studies sources of technological upgrading in China and India. What is striking about the impressive growth of China and (to a lesser degree) India is that they export products associated with a high productivity level that is much higher than a country at their income level. China’s export bundle has changed dramatically, diversifying into technologyintensive products. China is now the largest exporter of high-technology products in the world. Exports of India are still significantly less technologically sophisticated, while India has been more successful in exports of business and information technology (IT) services. It presents empirical evidence on the important role of FDI inflows and imported capital goods that embody new technology for TFP growth in a large panel of advanced and developing countries over 1970-2007. Consistent with the cross-country evidence, micro-data and case studies strongly suggest that FDI and import of capital goods have contributed to rapid technological upgrading especially in China. Puzzlingly, however, the TFP level in China is much lower than would be expected from its score on Index of Technological Sophistication of exports, raising a doubt about whether the shift in export bundle towards high-technology products is associated with a technological sophistication of domestic contents of export products. An important explanation appears to be China’s prime role as a final assembler of international production network. The magnitude of reversal in net export position of China across the two categories, intermediate and finished goods, is striking, which implies that more and less developed economies are being affected very differently by China’s rise. With a view to upgrading the capability to absorb advanced technologies and innovate, China and India have increasingly emphasised human capital, skill-intensive industries and R&D efforts. Nonetheless, our analysis shows that there is still an enormous scope for technological catching-up over the next decades.Modernisation technologique en Chine et en Inde : Que savons-nous?Ce papier étudie les sources de modernisation technologique en Chine et Inde. Ce qui est frappant dans la croissance impressionnante de la Chine et, dans une moindre mesure, de l’Inde est que ces pays exportent des produits associés à un haut niveau de productivité qui est bien plus grand qu’un pays de leur niveau de revenu. La structure des exportations de la Chine a fondamentalement changé, se diversifiant en produits intensifs en technologie. La Chine est dorénavant le plus grand exportateur du monde de produits de haute technologie. Les exportations de l’Inde restent significativement moins sophistiquées technologiquement, quoique l’Inde ait connu davantage de succès dans les exportations de services de technologie du commerce ainsi que de l’information et de la communication (TIC). Ce papier présente des preuves empiriques du rôle important des flux entrants d’IDE et des biens de capital importés comprenant la nouvelle technologie pour la croissance de PGF pour un large panel de pays avancés ou en développement sur la période 1970-2007. En ligne avec les preuves longitudinales, données microéconomiques et études de cas, il suggère fortement que les IDE et importations de biens de capital ont contribué à la rapide modernisation de technologie, particulièrement en Chine. Curieusement, cependant, le niveau de PGF en China est bien plus bas qu’espéré au regard de son Indice de Sophistication Technologique des Exportations, faisant naître le doute que la transformation de la structure des exportations vers des produits de haute-technologie est associée avec à une sophistication technologique du contenu national des produits d’exportation. Une explication importante réside dans le rôle de premier plan de la Chine en tant qu’assembleur final de la chaîne de production mondiale. La magnitude du revirement de la position nette des exportations de la China entre les deux catégories, produits intermédiaires et finaux, est saisissante, ce qui implique que les économies développées sont plus ou moins affectées et de façon très différente par la montée de la Chine. Dans l’optique d’améliorer la capacité d’absorber les technologies avancées et les innovations, la Chine et l’Inde ont mis l’accent sur le capital humain, les industries intensives en compétences et les efforts en R&D. Néanmoins, notre analyse montre qu’il reste une place énorme pour le rattrapage technologique dans les prochaines décennies.},

  abstract  = {The standard gravity model predicts that trade flows increase in proportion to importer and exporter total income, regardless of how income is divided into income per capita and population. Bilateral trade data, however, show that trade grows strongly with income per capita and is largely unresponsive to population. I develop a general equilibrium Ricardian model of trade that allows the elasticity of trade with respect to income per capita and with respect to population to diverge. Goods are of various types, which differ in their income elasticity of demand and in the extent to which there is heterogeneity in their production technologies. I estimate the model using bilateral trade data of 162 countries and compare it to a special case that delivers the gravity equation. The general model improves the restricted model's predictions regarding variations in trade due to size and income. I experiment with counterfactuals.

  abstract    = {We develop a framework for studying trade in vertically and horizontally differentiated products. In our model, consumers with heterogeneous incomes and tastes purchase a homogeneous good as well as making a discrete choice of quality and variety of a differentiated product. The distribution of preferences in the population generates a nested logit demand structure. These demands are such that the fraction of consumers who buy a higher-quality product rises with income. We use the model to study the pattern of trade between countries that differ in size and income distributions but are otherwise identical. Trade?which is driven primarily by demand factors?derives from "home market effects" in the presence of transport costs. The model helps to explain why richer countries export higher-quality goods. It provides a tractable tool for studying the welfare consequences of trade, transport costs, and trade policy for different income groups in an economy.},

  abstract  = {A substantial amount of theoretical work predicts that quality plays an important role as a determinant of the global patterns of bilateral trade. This paper develops an empirical framework to estimate the empirical relevance of this prediction. In particular, it identifies the effect of quality operating on the demand side through the relationship between per capita income and aggregate demand for quality. The model yields predictions for bilateral flows at the sectoral level and is estimated using cross-sectional data for bilateral trade among 60 countries in 1995. The empirical results confirm the theoretical prediction: rich countries tend to import relatively more from countries that produce high-quality goods. },

  abstract = {Recent literature has analyzed three main channels regarding the effect of international trade on legal institutions: overall openness to trade, a specialization on institutionally intensive exports, and a dependence on exports of natural resources. Unlike previous literature, we examine all these channels within a single regression framework. Importantly, we develop a new measure of institutional intensity of exports at the goods level based on nearly one hundred million disaggregated bilateral trade flows. Our new measure shows that goods subject to international fragmentation of production are the most institutionally intensive. Using a sample of 144 countries, our regression results show that specialization on institutionally intensive exports, especially on fragmented goods, helps countries to improve their rule of law. In addition, we find that greater openness improves the rule of law, but we fail to find any effect from natural resources exports.},

  abstract  = { Many students of statistics and econometrics express frustration with the way a problem known as “bad control” is treated in the traditional literature. The issue arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coefficient and the effect that the coefficient is intended to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. By making this “crash course” accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models. },

  abstract  = {Economic historians have long been aware of many forms of bias that could lead to spurious causal inferences. However, our approach to these biases has been muddled at times by dealing with each bias separately and by confusion about the sources of bias and how to mitigate them. This paper shows how the methodology of directed acyclical graphs (DAGs) formulated by Pearl (2009) and particularly the concept of collider bias can provide economic historians with a unified approach to managing a wide range of biases that can distort causal inference. I present ten examples of collider bias drawn from economic history research, focussing mainly on examples where the authors were able to overcome or mitigate the bias. Thus, the paper addresses how to diagnose collider bias and also strategies for managing it. The paper also shows that quasi-random experimental designs are rarely able to overcome collider bias. Although all of these biases were understood by economic historians before, conceptualising them as collider bias will improve economic historians’ understanding of the limitations of particular sources and help us develop better research designs in the future.},
