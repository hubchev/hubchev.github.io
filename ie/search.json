    "text": "Teaching principles\nI believe in the Keep It Simple and Straightforward principle (KISS), which emphasizes simplicity and clarity in all aspects of learning and teaching. This, however, does not imply that the content of the book easy to understand. Success still requires logical thinking and a strong work ethic. Those who struggle with this may find it difficult to pass my courses.\nIn the following sections, I will introduce various mathematical economic models and concepts that provide a structured framework for understanding economics. Familiarity with these concepts is necessary for understanding current literature and analyzing complex scenarios in international trade.\nEconomic models are based on transparent assumptions and usually consist of a set of equations that explain theories of economic behavior. A robust model should provide valuable insights into the behavior of rational actors and the workings of the economy.\nUnfortunately, students sometimes feel overwhelmed by these models because of their reliance on math and rigorous logical reasoning. There is often a perception that there are simpler ways to convey these arguments. While this may occasionally be true, I firmly believe that the formal approach to introducing international economics is most beneficial in the long run. Allow me to back up this belief:\n\nThe narrative method, characterized by storytelling and bullet points, is a quick way to convey information on a variety of topics. However, it also has its drawbacks: students can easily get caught up in intuitive anecdotes without developing critical thinking or recognizing the underlying driving forces. As a result, they memorize information only for exams and forget it shortly thereafter.\nUnlike anecdotes, formal models are not inherently true. Nevertheless, they can offer deeper insights into a topic than narratives.\nCompared to anecdotes, formal models usually offer more flexibility. Once students understand the underlying logic of a model and can interpret and evaluate its implications, they can apply their understanding to different circumstances or topics. In contrast, anecdotes often provide a narrow perspective on a problem, making it difficult to draw general conclusions.\nA mathematical economic model functions much like a proof of an argument in that it accurately describes the assumptions under which the argument holds. In contrast, narratives often obscure the underlying assumptions and premises of an argument.\nFormal argumentation is the norm in economic research. Familiarity with basic concepts therefore enables students to understand the current literature, conduct research and solve problems in their professional lives.\nUnderstanding an economic model means grasping the underlying relationships, which promotes retention. In essence, formal models promote students’ independent thinking and reasoning rather than mere repetition of the teacher’s words.",

Feynman’s Los Alamos ID badge\n\n\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Richard_Feynman_Los_Alamos_ID_badge.jpg\n\n\n\nRichard P. Feynman (1918-1988) was a team leader at the Manhatten Project (see Figure 2) and won the Nobel Prize in 1965 in physics. He once said:\n\n“I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way – by rote, or something.

However, I believe that there is no understanding without practice, that is, solving problems and exercises by yourself with a pencil and a blank sheet of paper without knowing the solution in advance. Thus, I recommend the following:\n\nAttend lectures and and take the opportunity to ask questions and actively participate in class.\nStudy the lecture notes and work on the exercises.\nReview the material regularly each week. Learning in small increments is more effective than last-minute cramming.\nTest yourself with past exams that you find in the appendix.\nIf you have the opportunity to form a study group, make use of it. It is great to help each other, and it is very motivating to see that everyone has problems sometimes.\nIf you have difficulties with some exercises and the solutions shown do not solve your problem, ask a classmate or contact me.",

    "text": "Exercise 1.2 Our relations are not good\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Trump doubles metal tariffs on Turkey by 20%\n\n\n\nSource: Twitter\n\n\n\nWhy is Trump implicitly expressing concerns about the weak Lira and the strong Dollar? Would he prefer a “strong” Turkish Lira and a “weak” Dollar? What factors actually contribute to his satisfaction? Can you understand the logic behind President Trump’s decision to double metal tariffs in response to the decline of the Turkish Lira (see Figure 1.2)? Discuss.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Exchange rates\nGross domestic product (GDP)1, the policy rate2 and the inflation rate3 are important measures that explain the functioning of economic markets and guide policy makers. The exchange rate is used less frequently in political and public debates despite the fact that it is an accurate measure that shows real movements in markets much faster than most other prominent measures, and these movements have a big impact on all people and economic markets. For example, an understanding of exchange rates is essential for students of international management to make informed decisions, manage financial risk, optimize operations, and strategically position their companies in the global marketplace. So why does the exchange rate fly so much under the radar of public debates? Here are some of my explanations:\n1 The total value added of a country in a given period2 The interest rate set by a central bank that influences the lending and borrowing rates of commercial banks to control inflation, manage employment levels and stabilize the currency.3 The percentage increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a given period.\nIt is comparatively difficult to interpret. GDP should be rising, the inflation rate as well as the policy rate should be low at best. In comparison, the exchange rate is not so trivial because there isn’t an optimal exchange rate everybody is hoping for. What you wish depends on many factors, such as whether you want to buy things from abroad or sell them to the rest of the world. Whether you are investing in a foreign country, working in the domestic tourism industry or working for a multinational cooperation. Most people, and especially politicians, try to avoid the complexity of the “it depends” arguments because it is difficult to make a convincing argument with relationships that are quite complicated.\nThe exchange rate is comparatively volatile and changes are difficult to predict.\nThere is not just one exchange rate, but many, as any currency can be exchanged for any other currency. This means that a country’s exchange rate may rise against currency A, but fall against currency B.\nThe power of politics to directly and measurably influence a country’s exchange rate is limited.\nThe impact of an exchange rate movement on our lives requires a good understanding of economic markets, which many people do not have.\n\nWhile I cannot undo the reasons why the exchange rate is not discussed broadly, I can try to give you the ability to make some sense out of it. Before discussing the importance of the exchange rate in Section 1.1.3, let’s first define the rate:\nThe price of one currency in terms of another is called an exchange rate. Exchange rates allow us to compare prices of goods and services across countries and they determine a country’s relative prices of exports and imports.\nSuppose the Euro (€) is the home currency and Turkish Lira (₺) the foreign currency, then the exchange rate in direct quotation (Preisnotierung) is \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}=\\frac{X \\text{€}}{Y \\text{₺}}\\] and the exchange rate in indirect quotation (Mengennotierung) is \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}=\\frac{Y \\text{₺}}{X \\text{€}}.\\]\nBoth rates contain the same information, but have different interpretations:\n\n\\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}\\) tells that we have to give X to receive Y , whereas\n\\(E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}\\) tells that we have to give Y to receive X .\n\nAlternative interpretations:\n\n\\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}\\) tells that we have to give \\(\\frac{X}{Y} \\text{€}\\) to receive 1 , whereas\n\\(E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}\\) tells that we have to give \\(\\frac{Y}{X} \\text{₺}\\) to receive 1 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppreciation / Depreciation\n\n\n\nA currency can appreciate or depreciate relative to other currencies.\n\nIf the appreciates, \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}\\) decreases and \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}\\) increases.\nIf the depreciates, \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}\\) increases and \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}\\) decreases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConventions to talk about exchange rates:\n\n\n\n\nEuro to Dollar means \\(\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\$}\\) (This is especially confusing and it can also be understood the other way round but the first currency mentioned is usually interpreted as the numerator)\nEuro per Dollar means \\(\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\$}\\)\nEuro in Dollar means \\(\\frac{\\$}{\\text{€}}\\)\n1 Euro costs X Dollars means X \\(\\frac{\\$}{\\text{€}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.3 Interpret the exchange rate representations shown in Figure 1.3. Consider the Euro as the home currency and write the most recent currency rates of the four figures in direct quotation.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Euro to Dollar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Subfigures (c) and (d) are taken from Google.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exchange rate in direct quotation is:\n\n\\[E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{\\$}}}=\\frac{X \\text{€}}{Y \\text{\\$}} = \\frac{1 \\text{€}}{1,0212 \\text{\\$}}=0.97924011 \\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{\\$}} \\] Figure 1.3 (a) is denoted in indirect quotation.

Calculate the equivalent amount in US Dollars at the exchange rate of \\(1.15 \\frac{EUR}{USD}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe equivalent amount in Euros for exchanging 500 US Dollars at the initial exchange rate of (1.20 , ) is given by: \\[\n\\text{Equivalent Euros} = \\frac{500 \\, \\text{USD}}{1.20 \\, \\text{USD/EUR}}\n\\]\nIf the exchange rate changes to (1.15 , ), the new equivalent amount in Euros is: \\[\n\\text{New Equivalent Euros} = \\frac{500 \\, \\text{USD}}{1.15 \\, \\text{USD/EUR}}\n\\]\nThe equivalent amount in US Dollars for spending 1,000 Euros at the initial exchange rate is: \\[\n\\text{Equivalent USD} = 1,000 \\, \\text{EUR} \\times 1.20 \\, \\text{USD/EUR}\n\\]\nIf the European tourist exchanges their money at the changed rate of (1.15 , ), the new equivalent amount in US Dollars is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Equivalent USD} = 1,000 \\, \\text{EUR} \\times 1.15 \\, \\text{USD/EUR}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Relative prices and exchange rates\nIn real businesses things and services are produced. Thus, the question of interest for most is how much other things can I buy when I sell one unit of my product.\nLet us consider a stylized example: Assume the home country produces beer and the foreign country produces wine. Further assume you want to exchange a beer for wine, then the relative price gives the amount of beer you have to give to receive a unit of wine (in the direct quotation), or the amount of wine you receive for a unit of beer (indirect quotation). A relative price of 1, for example, means that you can exchange 1 liter of beer with 1 liter of wine. However, we can also assume that beer is measured in cans of 500ml each and wine in 1 liter bottles. Then, the relative price would be \\[P^{\\frac{beer}{wine}}= \\frac{2 \\text{ beer}}{1 \\text{ wine}}.\\] Which means, you can convert 2 cans of beer for one bottle of wine. If this relative prices increase, I must give more beer to receive a wine, and if the relative prices decrease, I must give less beer to receive a wine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative prices\n\n\n\nRelative prices determine the relative price of commodities across countries. For example, an increase in the price of foreign commodities makes imported commodities relatively more expensive and home commodities relatively cheaper for buyers at home.\n\n\nRelative prices are (directly) determined by exchange rates. To logically prove this statement, let us assume for simplicity an exchange rate of 1, \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}=E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}=1\\] and that a liter of beer costs 1 € at home and a wine costs 1 ₺ abroad. Thus, we can buy both a wine or a beer for 1 €. Due to the fact that we must pay the wine producer with ₺, we must convert the € beforehand. The process goes like visualized in Figure 1.4:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: One wine per Euro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, assume that the € appreciates and the exchange rate becomes \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}=0.5\\) and \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}=2\\), respectively. Then, you receive more than one wine if we assume that the price of wine in ₺ remains unchanged. The process is visualized in Figure 1.5:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Two wine per Euro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means, exchange rates determine the relative prices. If the home currency appreciates (depreciates), buying goods and services abroad becomes relative cheaper (more expensive).\nOf course, if many people now buy wine and aim to convert €  to ₺, this may impact the exchange rate and the price of wine. We come back to that later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExchange rates and relative prices\n\n\n\nThe exchange rate determines the relative price of commodities across countries. For example, an appreciation of a currency makes commodities more expensive for foreign buyers and in turn makes foreign commodities cheaper for buyers at home.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 The importance of the exchange rate\nImport/export costs: Exchange rate fluctuations determine the relative prices and hence affect the cost of importing goods and materials and the global demand for domestic products. An appreciation of the home currency makes imports relatively cheaper but exports more expensive for the rest of the world, while depreciation has the opposite effect.\nRevenue conversion: Multinational companies earn revenues in multiple currencies. Exchange rate changes can significantly impact the value of these revenues when converted back to the home currency, affecting overall profitability.\nForeign investments: Companies investing in foreign assets or operations need to understand exchange rates to forecast returns accurately and manage exchange rate risk.\nRisk management: Knowledge of exchange rates enables businesses to hedge against currency risk using financial instruments like forwards, futures, options, and swaps. This is crucial for stabilizing cash flows and protecting profit margins.\nMarket competitiveness: Exchange rates affect the relative cost competitiveness of goods and services in international markets. Companies need to understand these implications to price their products competitively and make strategic decisions about entering or exiting markets.\nMacroeconomic Insights: Exchange rates are influenced by and also affect economic indicators such as inflation, interest rates, and economic growth. Understanding these relationships helps in making informed predictions about market conditions.\nContractual Agreements: Businesses engaged in international trade must understand exchange rates to negotiate and structure contracts effectively, determining terms such as the currency of payment and exchange rate clauses.\nGovernment and Policy Understanding: Exchange rates are often influenced by governmental and central bank policies. Understanding the dynamics between exchange rates and policy decisions is vital for anticipating regulatory changes and their potential impact on business operations.\n\n\n1.1.4 Trump, relative prices, and trade policy\nLet’s return to Trump’s Twitter message . Steel producers in the U.S. (and Donald Trump himself) are unhappy about a strong dollar (and a weak Turkish Lira) because it makes their products relatively expensive for Turkish buyers while making Turkish steel relatively cheap for U.S. consumers.\nTrump had two options to address this issue: altering the exchange rates or adjusting the relative prices of goods between countries. Changing the exchange rate directly is a challenging task. Although buying or selling currencies on the foreign exchange market can influence exchange rates, the market is so large that the actions Trump could take as President would have minimal impact (see Section 1.1.5). Adjusting policy rates could influence exchange rates more effectively, as we will discuss in Section 1.2. However, the Federal Reserve, which sets policy rates and thus has an impact on interest rates, operates independently from political orders. Consequently, Trump’s influence over their decisions is limited.\nAs a result, Trump chose to increase the price of foreign steel in the U.S. by introducing or raising tariffs. The approach works, American steel producing companies get protected from foreign competition and might sell more domestically. However, there many negative consequences that detoriate the overall welfare. Foremost, everybody in the U.S. must pay more for steel (and for products made with steel and aluminum). David Boaz, Executive Vice President of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, highlights this issue in his response on Twitter (see Figure 1.6).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Who wins in the end?\n\n\n\nSource: Twitter\n\n\n\nTo quantify the costs of Mr. Trumps’s tariffs, let me quote the well-written article by Amiti et al. (2019) (p. 188-189):\n\nAmiti, M., Redding, S. J., & Weinstein, D. E. (2019). The impact of the 2018 tariffs on prices and welfare. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 33(4), 187–210.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We find that by December 2018, import tariffs were costing US consumers and the firms that import foreign goods an additional $3.2 billion per month in added tax costs and another $1.4 billion per month in deadweight welfare (efficiency) losses. Tariffs have also changed the pricing behavior of US producers by protecting them from foreign competition and enabling them to raise prices and markups, and we estimate that the combined effects of input and output tariffs have raised the average price of US manufacturing by 1 percentage point, which compares with an annual average rate of producer price inflation from 1990 to 2018 of just over 2 percentage points. US tariffs and the foreign retaliatory tariffs also affect international supply chains, and we estimate that if the tariffs that were in place by the end of 2018 were to continue, approximately $165 billion of trade per year will continue to be redirected in order to avoid the tariffs. We also show that the rise in tariffs has reduced the variety of products available to consumers.”\n\n\n\nIn addition, it can be argued that increased tariffs might actually make the dollar stronger. If buyers stop purchasing steel from Turkey due to higher tariffs, they will need fewer Turkish lira and therefore will exchange fewer U.S. dollars for Turkish lira. This reduced demand for Turkish lira could lead to a stronger dollar.\nWhile raising tariffs and initiating trade disputes could be a strategy to gain political support and possibly get re-elected, there is a general consensus among economists that raising tariffs usually leads to economic losses and detrimental outcomes for all countries involved.\n\n\n1.1.5 The FOREX\n\n1.1.5.1 The market\nIn a market, individuals exchange goods and services, offering something to receive something else in return. In the FOREX (foreign exchange market), participants exchange currencies. Like all markets, the price here is influenced by the supply and demand dynamics of currencies.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Example of a foreign exchange market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Euro (€) is considered strong, the exchange rate \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}\\) is low:\n\nAt this lower exchange rate, there’s a high demand for Turkish Lira (₺) (point C), but the supply of ₺ is scarce (point E).\nConsequently, the Euro faces depreciation pressure, leading to an increase in the exchange rate \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}} \\uparrow\\).\n\nConversely, when the Euro (€) is weak, the exchange rate \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}\\) is high:\n\nWith the exchange rate high, the demand for ₺ drops (point A), while its supply burgeons (point F).\nAs a result, the Euro is under appreciation pressure, causing the exchange rate to decrease \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}} \\downarrow\\).\n\nPoint B represents the equilibrium exchange rate, where the demand for ₺ meets its supply. At this juncture, holders of ₺ are unwilling to part with more, and similarly, Euro holders are not inclined to exchange more.\n\nIn 2022, the daily (!) traded volume of currencies averaged approximately $ 7,506 billion, as highlighted in Table 1.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Daily turnover of global foreign exchange market from 2001 to 2022 (in billion U.S. dollars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n2001\n2004\n2007\n2010\n2013\n2016\n2019\n2022\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n1.239\n1.934\n3.324\n3.973\n5.357\n5.066\n6.581\n7.506\n\n\nUSD\n1.114\n1.702\n2.845\n3.371\n4.662\n4.437\n5.811\n6.639\n\n\nEUR\n470\n724\n1.231\n1.551\n1.790\n1.590\n2.126\n2.292\n\n\nJPY\n292\n403\n573\n754\n1.235\n1.096\n1.108\n1.253\n\n\nGBP\n162\n319\n494\n512\n633\n649\n843\n968\n\n\nCNY\n0\n2\n15\n34\n120\n202\n285\n526\n\n\nAUD\n54\n116\n220\n301\n463\n349\n446\n479\n\n\nCAD\n56\n81\n143\n210\n244\n260\n332\n466\n\n\nCHF\n74\n117\n227\n250\n276\n243\n326\n390\n\n\nAll others combined\n170\n251\n568\n786\n1124\n1223\n1921\n2093\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All others combined are: HKD, SGD, SEK, KRW, NOK, NZD, INR, MXN, TWD, ZAR, BRL, DKK, PLN, THB, ILS, IDR, CZK, AED, TRY, HUF, CLP, SAR, PHP, MYR.\nSource: https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data (July 18, 2018).\n\n\n\n1.1.5.2 Actors on the FOREX\nVarious key actors trade on the FOREY. In particular commercial banks, multinational corporations, and nonbank financial institutions, like investment funds, playing significant roles in trading and speculation. Central banks as play a role. They intervene to stabilize their national currency, influencing the market’s direction.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Players on the foreign exchange market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5.3 The vehicle currency\nInstead of converting directly between two less common currencies, it’s more efficient to use a broadly accepted and stable currency as a vehicle. That means, if you want to exchange currency A to B. You do not exchange currency A directly to B but you convert currency A first to the vehicle currency C and then from C to B.\nAs depicted in Figure 1.9, around 32% of all currency transactions included the Euro while a notable 88% involved the U.S. Dollar which makes the Dollar the standard vehicle currency. The Dollar acts as a medium in transactions between currencies that do not directly trade with high volume. This can reduce transaction costs and streamline the process.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Market share of leading foreign exchange currencies in 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6 Purchasing power parity assumption\nThe Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) assumption is also know as the law of one price. It says that in competitive markets with zero transportation costs and no trade barriers, identical goods have the same price all over the world when expressed in terms of the same currency. The idea behind this is that if prices differences would exist, profits could be made through international arbitrage, that is, the process of buying a good cheap in one country and selling the good with a profit in another country. This process can quickly equalize real price differences across countries.\nHowever, in the real world, prices differ substantially across countries (see the Big Mac Index in Table 1.2 and Exercise 1.5). The assumptions of the PPP do mostly not hold perfectly in reality: some goods and services are not trade-able, firms might have different degrees of market power across countries, and the transaction costs are not zero. Here are more reasons, why the PPP does not always apply, especially in the short run:\n\nTransportation costs are not zero. Shipping goods can be time consuming and expensive.\nMany goods and services, such as real estate or personal services, cannot be traded.\nInternational markets may be segmented due to regulatory barriers, tariffs and other trade restrictions.\nCountries have different consumption preferences. That means, the same basket of goods is not necessarily equally demanded. The willingness to pay for goods vary across countries often significantly.\nCountries impose different taxes and provide different subsidies on goods and services, which affects their prices and leads to deviations from PPPs.\nShort-term fluctuations in exchange rates may deviate from the values predicted by PPPs due to speculation, interest rate differentials and other factors.\nDifferences in inflation rates between countries may lead to deviations from PPP, especially in the short run.\nThe same product may be perceived differently in different countries due to brand names, quality differences or local customization, resulting in different prices.\nRegulations like warranty and product classifications are different and have an impact on the product and the willingness to pay for it.\nPolitical instability, war or economic sanctions can affect currency values and prices and lead to deviations from PPP.\nPrices of goods and services do not always adjust immediately to changes in the exchange rate, leading to short-term deviations from PPP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.5 Big Mac Index\nThe differences of prices across countries can be illustrated with the Economist’s Big Mac Index. It indicates the price of a Big Mac in different countries in terms of the US Dollar. Table 1.2 shows some countries with on average expensive and cheap Big Macs.\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: The price of a Big Mac across countries\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland\n$6.57 (6.50 CHF)\n\n\nSweden\n$5.83 (51.00 SEK)\n\n\nUnited States\n$5.51 (5.51 USD)\n\n\nNorway\n$5.22 (42 NOK)\n\n\nCanada\n$5.08 (6.65 CAD)\n\n\nEuro area\n$4.75 (4.56 EUR)\n\n\n…\n…\n\n\nEgypt\n$1.75 (31.37 EGP)\n\n\nUkraine\n$1.91 (50 UAH)\n\n\nRussia\n$2.09 (130 RUB)\n\n\nMalaysia\n$2.10 (8.45 MYR)\n\n\nIndonesia\n$2.19 (31,500 IDR)\n\n\nTaiwan\n$2.27 (69 TWD)\n\n\n\nSource: https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data (July 18, 2018).\n\n\n\n\nRead Wikipedia’s page on the Big Mac Index and discuss the Big-Mac-Index critically. Is it really a reasonable real-world measurement of purchasing power parity?\nCompare the Big-Mac-Index to the Mac-Index (see: themacindex.com) looking for price differences of the Mac mini M1 256GB. Why are the price differences for Apple products so much smaller compared to McDonald’s Big Mac? In case the website offline, here is a snapshot of it.)\nUsing the data of Table 1.2, calculate the exchange rate of Euros (EUR) to Swiss Francs (CHF) in both the direct and the indirect quotation. Interpret your result.\nCalculate how many Dollars you can buy with 100€. Then, use that dollars to buy Swiss Francs. How many Swiss Francs do you get?\nMultiple choice: Which of the following statements is true?\n\nThe table indicates that the Purchasing Power Parity Assumption is fulfilled.\nThe exchange rate of US Dollar to Swiss Franc (CHF) is close to one.\nThe exchange rate of US Dollar to the Russian Ruble (RUB) is about \\(62.2 \\frac{\\$}{RUB}\\).\nThe exchange rate of Canadian Dollar (CAD) to the Euro (EUR) is about \\(0.73\\).\nWith one Canadian Dollar (CAD) you can buy \\(0.73\\) US Dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Big Mac Index\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease take part in the discussion in class.\nPlease take part in the discussion in class.\nThe exchange rate of Euros to Swiss Francs in direct quotation is: \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{ EUR}}{\\text{ CHF}}}=\\frac{4.56 \\text{ EUR}}{4.75 \\text{ USD}} \\cdot \\frac{6.57 \\text{ USD}}{6.50 \\text{ CHF}} = \\frac{29.9592 \\text{ EUR}}{30.875 \\text{ CHF}} \\approx 0.9703 \\frac{\\text{ EUR}}{\\text{ CHF}}\\] and in indirect quotation: \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{ CHF}}{\\text{ EUR}}} \\approx 1.0305 \\frac{\\text{ CHF}}{\\text{ EUR}}.\\] That means, we have to pay about 0.97 Euro for one Swiss Franc or one Euro costs about 1.03 Swiss Franc.\nFor 100 Euro we get \\[100 \\text{ EUR} \\cdot \\frac{4.75 \\text{ USD}}{4.56\\text{ EUR}} \\approx 104.16 \\text{ USD}\\] and these can be converted to \\[104.16 \\text{ USD} \\cdot  \\frac{6.50 \\text{ CHF}}{6.57\\text{ USD}} \\approx 103.05 \\text{ CHF}\\]\nHere are the answers:\n\nis false: The price of a Big Mac in $ is different across countries.\nis correct.\n\nis false: 1 Ruble costs 0.0160 Dollar: \\[ \\frac{2.09\\text{ USD}}{130 \\text{ RUB}} = 0.016\\frac{\\text{ USD}}{\\text{RUB}}.\\]\nis incorrect: \\[\n\\underbrace{\\frac{6.65 \\text{ CAD}}{5.08 \\text{ USD}}}_{\\approx 1.309}\\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{4.75 \\text{ USD}}{4.56 \\text{ EUR}}}_{\\approx 1.0416} \\approx 1.36\\frac{\\text{ CAD}}{\\text{EUR}}.\n\\]\nis incorrect: \\[\n\\frac{6.05 \\text{ CAD}}{5.08 \\text{ USD}} \\approx 0.76 \\frac{\\text{ CAD}}{\\text{ USD}}.\n\\] Thus, with one Canadian Dollar you can buy 0.76 U.S. Dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.6 International arbitrage\n\n\n\nTable 1.3: Table of price variations across countries\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nPrice of Good 08/15\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n$2\n\n\nSwitzerland\n$6\n\n\nUnited States of America\n$6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a scenario where the good 08/15 is freely tradeable across countries without any cost (akin to digital software).

This is a classic arbitrage strategy.\nImpact on Prices: Consider that you repeat that winning strategy to buy in Germany and sell in some other country, prices will change: The increased demand in Germany will cause the price there to rise, while the increased supply in Switzerland and the USA will cause the price to drop.

    "text": "1.2 International investments\nInvesting or when storing purchasing power by holding a currency is speculative, regardless if the investment takes place at home or abroad. When holding a foreign currency, however, you must consider the fact that this currency can appreciate or depreciate. The value of a currency can fluctuate significantly over time, influenced by economic policy, market sentiment and global events. In the next sections, I present a framework that helps to understand the essential determinant of the rate of return on your investment.\n\n1.2.1 Foreign exchange reserves\nCurrencies serve as a store of value, an important function in the financial world. Foreign exchange reserves are assets held on reserve by a central bank in foreign currencies, which can include bonds, treasury bills, and other government securities. The primary purpose of holding foreign exchange reserves is to manage the exchange rate of the national currency and ensure the stability of the country’s financial system.\nAccordingly to the Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COVER) database of the International Moentary Fund (IMF), the total foreign exchange reserves in Q3 2023 had been 11,901,53 billion U.S. Dollar. That is, $ 11,901,530,000,000!\nThe size of a country’s foreign exchange reserves can be influenced by various factors, including its balance of trade, exchange rate policies, capital flows, and the overall health of its economy. While having substantial reserves is generally seen as a sign of economic strength and stability, excessively accumulating reserves can also indicate underlying economic imbalances or protectionist policies.\n\n\n1.2.2 Three components of the rate of return\nAn investment usually has different characteristics such as the default risk, opportunities, and liquidity. These characteristics and individual preferences are important to decide which investment is superior. In this course, however, we mostly refrain from discussing sophisticated features of investments here. We focus on the most important feature of an investment, that is, the rate of return. In particular, three components are important to calculate the rate of return:\n\n1.2.2.1 Interest rate\nThe interest rate of an investment is a crucial factor that determines the return earned on invested capital over a specific period. It represents the percentage of the initial investment that is paid back to the investor as interest or profit. Formally, we can write: \\[\n\\underbrace{I_{t-1}}_{\\text{investment in {t-1}}} \\cdot\\quad \\underbrace{(1+i)}_{1+\\text{interest rate}} = \\underbrace{I_{t}}_{\\text{payout amount in t}}\n\\tag{1.1}\\] where \\(I\\) denotes the value of an asset measured in € in the respective time period \\(t\\).\n\n\n1.2.2.2 Exchange rate\nWhen investing in assets denominated in foreign currencies, investors need to convert their domestic currency into the foreign currency at the prevailing exchange rate. After the investment has been paid out in the foreign country, the investor must convert the foreign currency back to his home currency. Thus, the initial cost of the investment and the subsequent returns are influenced by the exchange rate at the beginning and the end of the investment.\nFormally, we can write if the an investment takes in foreign country, that is, Turkey between \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\): \\[\nI^{\\text{€}}_{t-1}\\cdot E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}} \\cdot E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}= I_{t}^{\\text{€}}\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\n\n\n1.2.2.3 Inflation\nInflation refers to the quantitative measure of the rate at which prices, represented by a basket of goods and services, increase within an economy over a specific period. Conversely, negative inflation is termed deflation. Mathematically, inflation can be defined as follows:\n\\[\n\\pi = \\frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\pi\\) represents the inflation rate and \\(P_t\\) denotes the price at time \\(t\\). When inflation affects all prices, it also impacts the value of assets in which investors are invested. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\\[\nI_t = I_{t-1} \\cdot (1+\\pi)\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Rate of return of an investment abroad\nThe rate of return, \\(r\\), is the growth rate of an investment over time and can be described as follows: \\[\\begin{align*}\nr=& \\frac{I^{\\text{€}}_t-I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}}{I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}}=\\frac{I^{\\text{€}}_t}{I^{\\text{€}}_{t-1}}-1,\n\\end{align*}\\]\nCombining Equation 1.1, Equation 1.2, and Equation 1.3, we can describe the value of our investment in period \\(t\\) as follows: \\[\nI_{t}^{\\text{€}}= I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}} \\cdot (1+i^{*}) \\cdot E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}} \\cdot E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}} \\cdot  (1+\\pi^{*}),\n\\tag{1.4}\\] where \\(I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}\\) denotes the initial investment, \\(i^{*}\\) denotes the interest rate abroad and \\(\\pi^{*}\\) the inflation abroad. Dividing by \\(I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}\\) and subtracting \\(1\\) from both sides of Equation 1.4, we see that the rate of return for an investment abroad, \\(r^{*}\\), has three determining factors, that are: interest rate \\((1+i^*)\\), inflation \\((1+\\pi)\\), and the change of exchange rates over time \\((E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}} \\cdot E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}})\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\underbrace{\\frac{I_{t}^{\\text{€}}}{I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}}-1}_r^*&=\n(1+i^{*})\\cdot  (1+\\pi^{*}) \\cdot \\underbrace{E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}} \\cdot E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}}_\\alpha -1\\\\\nr^*&= (1+i^{*})\\cdot  (1+\\pi^{*}) \\cdot \\alpha -1  \n\\end{align*}\\] with\n\n\\(\\alpha=1\\) if the exchange rate does not change over time and\n\n\\(\\alpha&gt;1\\) if the home currency € depreciates or\n\\(\\alpha&lt;1\\) if the home currency € appreciates.\n\nSo the exchange rate changes over time work as a third factor of your rate of return.\nBy assuming no inflation (\\(\\pi^{*}=0\\)), we can write\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nr^*&=(1+i^{*}) \\cdot \\alpha -1\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=\\alpha +\\alpha i^{*}  -1.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.5}\\] Reorganizing Equation 1.5 helps to interpret it. Firstly, let us expand the right hand side of this equation adding and subtracting \\(i^*\\) which obviously does not change the sum of the right hand side of the equation. Secondly, re-write the equation and thirdly, set \\((\\alpha-1)=w\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=\\alpha +\\alpha i^{*}-1+i^*-i^*\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=\\alpha-1+i^* +\\alpha i^{*}-i^*\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=\\underbrace{(\\alpha -1)}_w+i^* +i^{*}\\underbrace{(\\alpha -1)}_w\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=w+i^* +i^{*}w\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nThis equation outlines the rate of return on an investment in a foreign country, influenced by two primary factors: \\(i^*\\) and \\(w\\).\nAssuming that the product \\(iw\\) is very small, we can say that the rate of return equals approximately the interest rate plus the rate of depreciation: \\[r^{*}=w+i^{*}.\\] This approximation is often called the simple rule for \\(r\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.8 Exchange rates and where to invest\nSuppose you want to buy a new car in Germany in one year, i.e, t=2023. Today, i.e., t=2022, you have €10,000 to invest for one year.\nGiven the following conditions:\n\nThe annual interest rate in Europe is 1%.\nThe annual interest rate in the U.S.A. is 2%.\nOne US-Dollar can be converted to €0.93 this year.\nYou expect that €1 can be converted to $1.09 next year.\nMoreover, you expect no inflation in Germany and the U.S.\nNo banking fees or alike.\n\n\nCalculate the return on an investment in the U.S. and Germany, respectively.\nDo you expect the euro to appreciate or depreciate from 2022 to 2023?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nExchange rates and where to invest (Exercise 1.8)\n\nRate of return in the EU is 1 percent and hence you will have 10,100 in 2023. Rate of return in the US is about 0.62 percent: \\[\n10000\\text{€} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\$}{0.93 \\text{€}}\\cdot 1.02 \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{€}}{1.09 \\$}= 10062.1485 \\text{€}\n\\] Thus, it is better to invest in Europe.\nIn 2022 you have to pay 93 Cent for a dollar and in 2023 you expect to pay about 91 Cent for a dollar. Thus, you expect the Euro to appreciate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.9 Turkey vs. Germany\nYou have 100€ this year, \\(t-1\\), which you like to invest till next year, \\(t\\).\n\nWhere should you invest, given the following informations:\n\nThe interest rate in Germany is 1%.\nThe interest rate in Turkey is 10%.\n1€ can be converted to 7 ₺ this year in the FOREX\nYou expect that 1 € can be converted to 7.1 ₺ next year in the FOREX.\nYou expect no inflation in Germany and Turkey.\n\nCalculate the exchange rate in period t that makes investing in Germany and Turkey equal profitable.\nExplain why the Turkish Lira is under appreciation pressure in t-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey vs. Germany (Exercise 1.9)\n\nWhen focusing solely on the interest rate, investing in Turkey appears more advantageous. However, if we consider only the development of the exchange rate, investing in Germany becomes more appealing due to the Euro appreciating relative to the Lira from period \\(t-1\\) to \\(t\\). Therefore, it’s essential to calculate the return on investment to determine which of the two effects predominates.

That means the demand curve in the FOREX shifts upwards till the exchange rate equals the exchange rate that makes both investments equal profitable and hence nobody has an incentive to demand more ₺ for the given exchange rate \\(E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*}_{t}\\) as calculated above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.10 Suppose you have 50,000 Indian Rupees (INR) this year that you want to invest for one year from \\(t\\) to \\(t+1\\) and then buy something with the Indian Rupees in India. Calculate the return on an investment in India and Germany, given the following conditions:\n\nThe annual interest rate in India is 5% and 2% in Germany.\n1 INR can be converted to 0.01 Euro (EUR) this year, \\(t\\).\n\nYou expect the Indian Rupee to depreciate, that is, you expect 1 EUR to cost 1 INR more next year, that is \\(t+1\\).\nMoreover, you expect no inflation in India and Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe return on investment for the investment in India is 5%.\nThe return on investment for the investment in Germany can be calculated as follows: \\[\n50,000 \\ \\text{INR} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{0.01 \\text{EUR}}{1 \\ \\text{INR}}}_{= \\frac{100 \\ \\text{INR}}{1 \\ \\text{EUR}}} \\cdot 1.02 \\cdot  \\frac{101 \\ \\text{INR}}{1 \\ \\text{EUR}}  = 51,510  \\ \\text{INR}\n\\] To calculate the rate of return calculate \\[\n\\frac{51,510-50,000}{50,000}\\cdot 100=3.02.\n\\] Thus, the return on investment for the investment in Germany is 3.02%. One challenge of this exercise is to consider “1 EUR to cost 1 INR more” properly. This does not mean 1 INR is equal to 1 €!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 The interest parity condition\nAssume the rate of return is lower domestically than it is for investments abroad. Representing the foreign country with an asterisk \\((*)\\), this situation, where investing money abroad is more profitable, can be expressed as:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nr&&lt;r^{*}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Given that domestically the rate of return, \\(r\\), equals the interest rate, \\(i\\), assuming zero inflation, and that the simple rule for an investment abroad is described by \\(r^{*} = w + i^{*}\\), we can rewrite the equation as: \\[\ni&lt; w+i^{*}.\n\\] What would happen if financial market actors became aware of this?\nMarket participants would likely convert their domestic currency into the foreign currency to invest abroad, increasing demand for the foreign currency. Consequently, the foreign currency would appreciate, becoming relatively more expensive. This implies that \\(w\\) is negative. This appreciation process halts when investing abroad no longer offers a higher return. If the attractiveness of investments is equalized, the FOREX is in equilibrium. The deposits of all currencies offer the same expected rate of return. In other words, in equilibrium the exchange rate, \\(w\\), assures that the rate of return from the home country, \\(r\\), is equal to the rate of return in any foreign country, denoted with an asterisk (\\(*\\)):\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  r&=r^{*}\\\\\n  i&= w + i^{*}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\] \\[ \\Leftrightarrow w= i-i^{*} \\tag{1.7}\\]\nThe interest parity condition (Equation 1.7) enables us to analyze how variations in interest rates and expected exchange rates affect current exchange rates through comparative static analysis of the equation: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial i} &gt; 0; \\quad \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial i^*} &lt; 0.\n\\] This means:\n\nAn increase in the domestic interest rate results in a positive change in the depreciation rate, leading to the depreciation of the domestic currency.\nAn increase in the foreign interest rate causes a negative change in the depreciation rate, resulting in the appreciation of the domestic currency.\n\n\n\n1.2.5 The theory in real markets: Unpegging the Swiss Franc\nYou might now question whether this theory of the interest parity condition truly holds in real-world markets. Analyzing international markets and the FOREX empirically is challenging due to the frequent occurrence of both large and small exogenous shocks on a global scale, each impacting market outcomes in various ways. Furthermore, market dynamics are often influenced by emotions and speculation rather than solely measurable facts. However, there are instances where the shocks are so significant that the fundamental forces driving the market become visible, even without a sophisticated empirical identification strategy that controls for confounding effects. The case study of the unexpected unpegging of the Swiss Franc serves as a poignant example. It vividly demonstrates that the principles underpinning the interest parity condition are not merely theoretical constructs but actively influence real market behaviors.\nUntil early 2015, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) had a policy goal to maintain the franc above the cap of 1.20 Francs per Euro, aiming to protect exporters and combat deflationary pressures. However, in a surprising move, the SNB unpegged the Franc in 2015. This decision was influenced by the appreciation pressure on the Franc, as many investors many investors wanted to store their assets in the Swiss Franc. Following the SNB’s announcement, the exchange rate plunged from 1.20 to 1.00 Franc per Euro \\((E^{\\frac{CHF}{\\text{€}}})\\), as illustrated in Figure 1.11 (a) Almost simultaneously, the interest rate experienced a decline, as depicted in Figure 1.11 (b). These developments align precisely with what the interest parity condition would predict, demonstrating its applicability in real-world financial market dynamics.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.11: The impact of unpegging the Franc on capital markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The exchange rate: \\(E^{\\frac{CHF}{\\text{€}}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Interest rate for investments in Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo analyze the relationship between changes in exchange rates and interest rates, we need to consider the interest parity assumption of Equation 1.7: \\[\nw= i-i^{*}\n\\] where \\[w=\\frac{E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}}{E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}}-1.\\] In January 2015, the exchange rate \\(E^{\\frac{CHF}{\\text{€}}}\\) decreased from 1.20 to 1.00. Alternatively, we can express this change in direct quotation, noting that the exchange rate \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}\\) increased from \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}_{t-1}\\approx \\frac{1}{1.20}\\approx 0.83\\) to \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}_{t}\\approx 1.00\\), resulting in \\[\n  w=\\frac{E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}}{E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}}-1=\\frac{1}{0.83}-1=0.20.\n\\]\nSince \\(w &gt; 0\\), the fraction on the left-hand side of the interest rate parity equation must also be positive, as already mentioned. This implies that \\[i - i^* &gt; 0,\\] which means that an interest rate spread must occur. This condition can occur if the foreign interest rate \\(i^*\\) decreases or the domestic interest rate \\(i\\) increases. In our observations, we can indeed see a pattern that is consistent with our theoretical expectations.\nIt is important to acknowledge that our theoretical framework simplifies the complex interplay of factors that influence both exchange rates and interest rates. Despite this simplification, the model highlights the key forces driving market dynamics. However, it is important to point out that the actual numbers may not perfectly match our theoretical predictions in quantitative terms, as shown in Figure Figure 1.12.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: Short-term interest rates across Germany and Switzerland over time\n\n\n\nSource: Data are taken from the OECD and show the total, % per annum.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.6 The Fisher effect\nThe Fisher Effect is an economic theory proposed by economist Irving Fisher (1867-1947), which describes the relationship between inflation and both nominal and real interest rates. According to the Fisher Effect, the nominal interest rate is equal to the sum of the real interest rate and the expected inflation rate. In formula terms, it is often expressed as: \\[\nr=i+\\pi.\n\\] We can derive this equation which you see in almost every introductory economics textbook using Equation 1.5 and ignoring international exchanges as the Fisher Effect does not alter with international investments, that means, we assume that the exchange rate is stable over time (\\(E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}} =E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}\\)): \\[\\begin{align}\nI_{t} =&    I_{t-1} \\cdot  (1+\\pi) \\cdot (1+i) \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\frac{I_{t} }{I_{t-1}}-1=&  (1+\\pi)(1+i)-1  \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r=&  i+ \\pi+ \\pi i\n\\end{align}\\] Assuming that the product \\(\\pi i\\) is very small, we can say that the rate of return equals approximately the interest rate plus the inflation rate. This approximation is often called the Fisher Effect.\nAbstracting from exchange rate movements and interest rate differences, the rate of return is solely determined by the inflation rate and cross-country differences in their rate of return can be described by differences in inflation rates: \\[r_{GER}-r_{TUR}= \\pi_{GER}-\\pi_{TUR}.\\]",

    "text": "1.3 Balance of payments\n\n1.3.1 Introduction\nThe Balance of Payments is a record of a country’s financial transactions with the rest of the world. It tracks the money flowing in and out through various economic activities. If we account for all transactions, the inflow and outflow should theoretically balance. Before I elaborate on this concept, let’s clarify some key terms:\n\nExports: Goods and services sold to other countries.\nImports: Goods and services bought from other countries.\nTrade balance: The difference between the value of goods and services a country sells abroad and those it buys from abroad, also known as net exports.\nTrade surplus: When a country sells more than it buys, resulting in a positive trade balance.\nTrade deficit: When a country buys more than it sells, leading to a negative trade balance.\nBalanced trade: When the value of exports equals imports.\nNet capital outflow: The difference between the purchase of foreign assets by domestic residents and the purchase of domestic assets by foreigners. This equals net exports, indicating that a country’s savings can fund investments domestically or abroad. We will elaborate on that later on in greater detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.11 Some facts about foreign trade\nMake yourself familiar with the descriptive statistics at destatis.de, the World Trade Organization here and here, the OECD, and World Trade Historical Database by the CEPR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.12 Figure 1.13 represents the foreign investment surplus and the trade deficit. Discuss why the two lines mirror each other. Could this be a coincidence?\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: U.S. Balance of Payments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 The payments must be balanced!\nEvery international financial transaction is essentially an exchange. When a country sells goods or services, the buying country compensates by transferring assets. Consequently, the total value of goods and services a country sells (its net exports) must be equal to the value of assets it acquires (its net capital outflow).\nThe Balance of Payments account consists of two primary components:\n\nThe Current account (Leistungsbilanz) measures a country’s trade balance (goods and services exports minus imports) plus the effects of net income and direct payments. It is positive, if a country is a net lender to the rest of the world and negative, if it is a net borrower from the rest of the world. In other words, an account surplus increases a country’s net foreign assets.\nThe Capital account (Kapitalbilanz) reflects the net change in ownership of national assets. Capital can flow in the form of following:\n\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI): It involves investing in foreign companies with the intention of controlling or significantly influencing their operations.\nForeign Portfolio Investment (FPI): This type of investment is in foreign financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, where the investor does not seek control over the companies.\nOther investments: This includes capital flows into bank accounts or funds provided as loans. It also encompasses the reserve account, which is managed by the central bank responsible for buying and selling foreign currencies.\n\n\nIgnoring statistical effects, these two subaccounts must sum to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nImagine Boeing, an American company, sells airplanes to a Japanese airline:\n\nBoeing transfers airplanes to the Japanese firm, and in return, the Japanese firm pays Boeing in Yen. This transaction increases exports (boosting net exports) and results in the United States acquiring foreign assets in the form of Yen (increasing net capital outflow).\nBoeing might then convert its Yen to U.S. Dollars through a financial exchange. For example, if an American mutual fund wants to invest in a Japanese company, Boeing’s sale of planes (a net export) is mirrored by the mutual fund’s investment in Japan (a net capital outflow).\nAlternatively, Boeing could exchange its Yen with an American company looking to purchase goods or services from Japan. In this scenario, the value of imports matches the value of exports, leaving net exports unchanged.\n\n\n\nWhile it’s true that the overall totals of payments and receipts must inherently balance, certain transaction types can create imbalances, leading to either deficits or surpluses. These imbalances may manifest in various sectors such as trade in goods (commodities), services trade, foreign investment income, unilateral transfers (including foreign aid), private investment, and the flow of gold and currency between central banks and treasuries, among other international dealings. It’s crucial to note, though, that the accounting framework ensures these surpluses and deficits ultimately zero out, adhering to the principles of double-entry bookkeeping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nTake, for example, a scenario where Americans purchase cars from Germany without engaging in any other transactions with it. The outcome is that Germans accumulate dollars, which can be maintained as bank deposits in the United States or within other U.S.-based assets. The American payment for German automobiles is counterbalanced by German acquisitions of dollar assets, including investments in U.S. entities and institutions. This exchange means Germany sells cars to the U.S., while the U.S. sells dollars or dollar-backed assets to Germany. Consequently, Germany experiences a trade surplus, indicated by a positive trade balance and a corresponding surplus in its current account, which encompasses the trade balance. Nonetheless, this also implies Germany faces a deficit in its capital account, characterized by a net outflow of money.\n\n\nTable 1.5\n\n\n\nTable 1.5: A hypothetical account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceipt (credit)\n\nPayments (debits)\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Account\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

These imbalances are not merely numerical figures; they reflect underlying economic activities and policy decisions with significant implications for national and global economic health.\n\n1.3.3.1 Current account imbalances\nThe current account includes trade in goods and services. A surplus in the current account indicates that a country is exporting more goods than it imports.\nSurpluses: Normatively, persistent current account surpluses might be viewed as a sign of a country’s competitive strength in the global market. However, they can also indicate underconsumption or insufficient domestic investment, suggesting that a country is not fully utilizing its economic resources to improve the living standards of its population. Furthermore, large surpluses can lead to tensions with trading partners and might prompt accusations of unfair trade practices or currency manipulation.\nDeficits: On the other hand, persistent deficits could signal domestic economic vitality and an attractive environment for investment, reflecting high consumer demand and robust growth. Yet, they can also indicate structural problems, such as a lack of competitiveness, reliance on foreign borrowing to sustain consumption, or inadequate savings rates. Over time, large deficits may lead to unsustainable debt levels, making the country vulnerable to financial crises.\n\n\n1.3.3.2 Capital account imbalances\nThe capital account records the net change in ownership of national assets. It includes the flow of capital into and out of a country, such as investments in real estate, stocks, bonds, and government debt.\nInflows: Capital account inflows can signify strong investor confidence in a country’s economic prospects, potentially leading to increased investment and growth. However, excessive short-term speculative inflows can destabilize the economy, leading to asset bubbles and subsequent financial crises when the capital is suddenly withdrawn.\nOutflows: Capital outflows might indicate a lack of confidence in the domestic economy or better opportunities abroad. While some level of outflow is normal for diversified investment portfolios, large and rapid outflows can precipitate a financial crisis by depleting foreign reserves and putting downward pressure on the currency.\n\n\n\n1.3.4 A formal representation\nIn the following, I present a streamlined perspective on the global trading system. This overview does not engage with the benefits or drawbacks of maintaining trade surpluses or deficits, a subject that warrants its own discussion. However, it aims to identify the factors influencing current account deficits and surpluses.\n\n1.3.4.1 Closed economy\nWithin a closed economy, we identify three principal actors: households, firms, and the government. Let’s define \\(C\\) as the consumption of goods and services by households, encompassing necessities and luxuries like food, housing, and entertainment. Let \\(G\\) represent government expenditures, which cover infrastructure, social services, military outlays, education, and more. Lastly, \\(I\\) symbolizes the investment by firms in assets such as machinery, buildings, and research and development. Given these components, the total economic output, \\(Y\\), can be expressed by the fundamental equation of economics as:\n\\[\nY = C + I + G.\n\\]\nThis equation encapsulates the aggregate spending within a closed economy, highlighting the interplay between consumption, investment, and government expenditure in determining overall economic activity.\nIf we define national savings, \\(S\\), as the share of output not spent on household consumption or government purchases, then the investments, \\(I\\), must be equal to the savings in a closed economy: \\[\\begin{align*}\nY &= C + I + G\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\underbrace{Y - C - G}_S &= I \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow S &= I,\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis implies that within a closed economy, any portion of the output that is not consumed—either privately by households (\\(C\\)) or by the government (\\(G\\))—necessarily must be allocated towards investment (\\(I\\)). Thus, the equation underscores a foundational economic principle: the total output of an economy (\\(Y\\)) is either consumed or invested, leaving no surplus output.\n\n\n1.3.4.2 Open economy\nIn an open economy, the dynamics of household consumption, government expenditures, and firm investments extend beyond domestic production to include imports from and exports to foreign markets. Thus, an economy can import and export goods. Denoting imports by \\(IM\\) and exports by \\(EX\\), we can re-write the fundamental equation of economics by adding the concept of net exports (\\(NEX\\)), the difference between a country’s exports and imports. A positive net export value (\\(EX &gt; IM\\)) indicates a trade surplus, reflecting that the economy exports more than it imports. Conversely, a negative net export value (\\(EX &lt; IM\\)) signifies a trade deficit, where imports exceed exports:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nY &= C + I + G + \\underbrace{EX - IM}_{NEX}\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\underbrace{Y - C - G}_S &= I + NEX\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\underbrace{S-I}_{NCO} &= NEX\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn scenarios where investment equals savings (\\(I = S\\)), the economy’s net exports are zero, reflecting a balance between domestic production not allocated towards household or government consumption and investments. However, when an economy experiences a trade surplus (\\(NEX &gt; 0\\)), such as Germany in recent decades, it implies that domestic savings exceed investments. This surplus indicates that the country produces more than it spends on domestic goods and services, channeling excess savings into investments abroad. Thus, savings not utilized domestically (\\(S - I\\)) are equivalent to the net capital outflow (\\(NCO\\)), establishing a direct link between a country’s trade surplus and its role as a global lender or investor:\n\\[\nNCO = NEX\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet exports must be equal to net capital outflow\nThe accounting identities above simply state that there is a balance of payments. The Balance of Payment accounts are based on double-entry bookkeeping and hence the annual account has to be balanced. If an economy has a current account trade deficit (surplus), it is offset one-to-one by a capital account surplus (deficit) to assure a balance of payments. In other words, if an economy wants to import more goods than it produces, it must attract foreign capital to be invested at home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Case study: U.S. trade deficit\nConsider a scenario where the United States is unable to attract sufficient capital flows from abroad to finance its trade deficit. In such a case, American consumers continue purchasing foreign goods with US Dollars, leading to an outflow of US Dollars that surpasses inflow. This imbalance results in an increased supply of US Dollars relative to its demand, causing the value of the US Dollar to depreciate. A depreciated US Dollar would, in theory, make US exports more competitive (cheaper for foreign buyers) and imports more costly, thereby potentially reducing the current account deficit. However, the trade deficit of the United States has remained relatively stable, and the US Dollar has not experienced significant depreciation. This stability is partly why former President Trump criticized other countries for allegedly manipulating their currencies, see Figure 1.14.\nTrump’s stance on the trade deficit was clear: he perceived it as detrimental to the United States. He advocated for a weaker dollar and lower interest rates to address this issue. A weaker dollar would render American products more affordable internationally, stimulating exports and discouraging imports. Concurrently, lower interest rates in the United States would diminish the country’s appeal for foreign capital investments (\\(I\\) would decrease), leading to reduced net capital inflows. This adjustment would, in turn, decrease the Capital Account surplus and, by extension, shrink the Current Account deficit. Specifically, Trump accused the Chinese government and the European Central Bank of implementing policies that undervalue their currencies (the Renminbi and the Euro), thereby gaining an unfair advantage in trade.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.14: Trump worries about the U.S. trade deficit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Trump thinks a trade deficit is bad for the United States, he would like to have a weak dollar and low interest rates. A weak dollar makes American products cheap for the rest of the world and has positive effects on exports and negative on imports. A low interest rate in the United States would make the country less attractive for foreign capital investments (\\(I\\) would become smaller), meaning the net capital inflows would decrease and so would the Capital Account’s surplus (and with it, the Current Account deficit would become smaller). In concrete terms, he claims that in particular the Chinese government and the European Central Bank run policies that keep their currencies (Renminbi and Euro) cheap.\nDespite significant efforts by President Trump to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, the endeavor did not achieve its intended outcome, as illustrated in Figure 1.15. One likely reason for this shortfall was the reduction of taxes for large corporations, which enhanced the rate of return on investments. This policy made investing in the U.S. more appealing to foreign investors, potentially counteracting efforts to diminish the trade deficit.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.15: The trade deficit of the United States over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.13 Discuss the pros and cons of Germany’s net export surplus.

While this reasoning is persuasive, it alone does not fully justify unrestricted international trade. In the following chapters, we will look at the concept that trade should be mutually beneficial to the parties directly involved. We will also discuss the ways in which trade can be beneficial to all parties, even though it is not necessarily beneficial to all. The remainder is structured as follows:\nN. Gregory Mankiw (*1958) is one of the most influential economists.

In some ways, this is true, for American and Japanese firms do produce many of the same goods. Ford and Toyota compete for the same customers in the market for automobiles. Compaq and Toshiba compete for the same customers in the market for personal computers.\nYet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries. Trade between the United States and Japan is not like a sports contest, where one side wins and the other side loses. In fact, the opposite is true: Trade between two countries can make each country better off.\nTo see why, consider how trade affects your family. When a member of your family looks for a job, he or she competes against members of other families who are looking for jobs. Families also compete against one another when they go shopping, because each family wants to buy the best goods at the lowest prices. So, in a sense, each family in the economy is competing with all other families.\nDespite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself from all other families. If it did, your family would need to grow its own food, make its own clothes, and build its own home. Clearly, your family gains much from its ability to trade with others. Trade allows each person to specialize in the activities he or she does best, whether it is farming, sewing, or home building. By trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost.\nCountries as well as families benefit from the ability to trade with one another. Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services. The Japanese, as well as the French and the Egyptians and the Brazilians, are as much our partners in the world economy as they are our competitors.",

    "text": "2.2 Reasons for Trade\nTrade involves willingly giving up something to receive something else in return, which should benefit both parties involved, although not necessarily everyone affected by the trade. We will discuss the negative effects of international trade on bystanders later. In this section, we briefly outline basic reasons for individuals and hence countries to engage in trade. Of course, the list is incomplete.\nDifferences in Technology: Advantageous trade can occur between countries if they have different technological abilities to produce goods and services. Technology refers to the techniques used to convert resources (labor, capital, land) into outputs. Differences in technology form the basis for trade in the Ricardian Model of comparative advantage. We will revisit this in more detail in Section 2.5.\nDifferences in Endowments: Trade also occurs because countries differ in their resource endowments, which include the skills and abilities of the workforce, available natural resources, and the sophistication of capital stock such as machinery, infrastructure, and communication systems. Differences in resource endowments are the basis for trade in the pure exchange models (see Section 2.3) and the Heckscher-Ohlin Model (see Section 2.6).\nDifferences in Demand: Trade between countries occurs because demands or preferences differ. Individuals in different countries may prefer different products even if prices are the same. For example, Asian populations might demand more rice, Czech and German people more beer, the Dutch more wooden shoes, and the Japanese more fish compared to Americans.\nEconomies of Scale in Production: Economies of scale, where production costs fall as production volume increases, can make trade between two countries advantageous. This concept, known as increasing returns to scale, plays a significant role in Paul Krugman’s New Trade Theory, which we will discuss later.\nExistence of Government Policies: Government tax and subsidy programs can create production advantages for certain products, leading to advantageous trade arising solely from differences in government policies across countries. We will explore the impact of tariffs and regulations in Chapter 3.",

In trade, barter is a system of exchange in which participants in a transaction directly exchange goods or services for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Stylized example of weißwürst and pretzels\n\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\n\nSuppose there are two people, Anton (A) and Barbara (B). Anton has 10 Weißwürste (white sausages) and Barbara has 10 pretzels. Together, they are isolated from the rest of the world for a few days due to a natural disaster. Fortunately, they both have additional access to an endless supply of sweet mustard and beer and they now wonder how to share pretzels and sausages the upcoming days. Let’s assume that both of them accept only a white sausage eaten together with a pretzel. That is, eating two pretzels with a sausage is no better than eating a pretzel and a sausage. After some discussion, Barbara gives 5 pretzels and Anton gives Barbara 5 sausages in return. They strongly believe that there is no better way to share food.\nThis example shows that trade can be beneficial for two individuals. Here we basically assume two things. Firstly, two individuals can trade and secondly, they are endowed with different goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.1 How Barbara and Anton trade (Solution 2.1)\n\nVisualize the starting point of Anton and Barbara as described above in a two-way plot where the Anton’s initial endowment with sausages is drawn on the y-axis and Barbara’s endowment with pretzels is drawn on the x-axis.\nGiven their preferences, mark the consumption point after goods were traded. Also, draw in the plot how much Anton and Barbara exports and imports, respectively.\nSketch the indifference curve of both individuals in the consumption point after trade has happened.\nDraw a new two-way plot and assume that Barbara now gives away 2 pretzels in order to receive one sausage. Mark the resulting consumption points of Anton and Barbara. Given their unchanged preference for having one sausage with one slice of bread at best, visualize with the help of sketched indifference curves that both individuals are worse off as compared to consuming 5 units of pretzels and sausages each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 2.1. How Barbara and Anton trade (Exercise 2.1)\nIn Figure 2.3 you find a sketch of a solution to tasks a. to c. Figure 2.4 provides a solution to task d.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The deal of Anton and Barbara\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Indifference curves of Anton and Barbara\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Terms of trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nThe terms of trade is defined as the quantity of one good that exchanges for a quantity of another. It is typical to express the terms of trade as a ratio.\n\n\nIn the example of Barbara and Anton, the exchange of goods occurs at a 1:1 ratio. In economics, this is referred to as the terms of trade being 1. The terms of trade are defined as the relative price of exports in relation to imports, or in other words, how much of one good can be exchanged for another. For instance, determining how many sausages can be exchanged for how many pretzels. The terms of trade, determined by the two trading partners, depend on a variety of distinct factors, including:\nPreferences: For trade to occur, each trader must desire something the other has and be willing to give up something of their own to obtain it. Formally, the expected utility of consuming some of Anton’s bread must exceed the disutility of foregoing a few of his sausages, and vice versa for Barbara. Typically, the goods are substitutable rather than perfectly complementary, as is assumed in our specific example.\nUncertainty: Both individuals have clear preferences. If Barbara has never tried Anton’s sausages, and Anton typically prefers bread over pretzels, offering free samples before an exchange could reduce uncertainty. Without a sample, their trade would be based on expectations about the taste of the other’s product.\nScarcity: The availability of the two goods influences the terms of trade. If, for instance, Barbara has 1000 pretzels, the terms of trade with the sausages would likely change.\nSize: The physical size of the goods can impact the terms of trade.\nQuality: The quality of goods affects the terms of trade. If the pretzels are stale and hard, both might prefer fewer pretzels per sausage.\nPersuasion: If Barbara is a more persuasive salesperson than Anton, she might be able to negotiate more favorable terms of trade.\nGovernment Policy: Taxes imposed by an official based on the traded quantities could affect the terms of trade. Additionally, if laws prevent Barbara and Anton from meeting, no trade would occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2 Terms of trade (?sol-Termsoftrade)\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Optimal consumption point\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you have a fixed income \\(I=10\\) that you can spend on consuming two substitutable goods \\(x, y\\) at certain prices \\(p_x=1, p_y=1\\). The current consumption decission is sketched in the figure above. Suppose the price of good \\(x\\) increases, that is, \\(p_x=2\\). Draw the new budget line. How will consumption change? What are the new terms of trade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new point of optimal consumption \\(OCP_1\\) at \\((x=2,y=6)\\) illustrates that an increase in the price of good \\(x\\) leads consumers to substitute good \\(x\\) and consume more of good \\(y\\) but less of good \\(x\\).\nThe terms of trade are now \\(\\frac{p_x}{p_y}=2\\). That is, consumers are willing to give up 1 unit of good \\(x\\) to receive 2 units of good \\(y\\). The budget line is drawn in blue.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Optimal consumption point after price increase\n\n\n\nNote: The indifference curve \\(IC_1\\) in the graph is just a guess of mine because we don’t have preferences in form of a utility function given. For example, you can also draw an indifference curve that gives you the optimal consumption point at \\((x= 1;y= 8)\\) or \\((x= 4;y= 2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Endowments in an Exchange Economy\nIn this section, we examine a basic scenario where productive units within an economy are unable to adjust their output to recent changes in world market prices, which stem from global demand and supply fluctuations. Economists refer to the resulting availability of goods as endowments. Essentially, a country is endowed with a certain quantity of goods and seeks to trade these goods on global markets to maximize its welfare. In Section 2.6 we will assume that countries are endowed with a certain amount of factors of production that they can use to produce various goods.\n\n2.3.3.1 Fixed production\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Optimizing consumption through trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine that country H produces \\(\\bar{x}^H_1\\) units of good 1 and \\(\\bar{x}^H_2\\) units of good 2. In autarky (a state of where there is no trade), it consumes all the goods it produces. This scenario is shown in Figure 2.7, where point A represents the optimal welfare outcome with utility \\(W^H_A\\) for country H in autarky.\nNow, let’s assume country H can trade with the rest of the world at global market prices, where the price ratio of good 1 to good 2 in the world market, \\(( \\frac{p_1}{p_2} )_W\\), is greater than in autarky, \\(( \\frac{p_1}{p_2} )_A\\): \\[\\begin{align}\n\\left( \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\right)_W &gt; \\left( \\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_A,\n\\end{align}\\]\nWith trade, country H can achieve a higher utility, \\(W_T^H&gt;W_A^H\\), by exporting good \\(x_1\\) and importing good \\(x_2\\), thus moving to a more advantageous consumption point.\n\n\n2.3.3.2 Flexible production\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Optimizing consumption by adjusting production and trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade is even more beneficial to a country if it can adjust its production to export more goods that are relatively high priced in the world market. This statement is shown in Figure 2.8.\nIn autarky, optimal consumption would be at point A and optimal consumption would be at point C under free trade. Now suppose that producers in country H know that they can sell their goods at price \\(p_1^W\\) and \\(p_2^W\\) before deciding what to produce. Then they would choose production point B on the production frontier curve to export good \\(x_1\\) and import good \\(x_2\\) at price \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_A\\) to be consumed at point D. Welfare at point D is higher than at point C or A because we end up at the highest indifference curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3 Production and consumption\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Optimizing consumption by adjusting production and trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.9 the production possibility frontier curve, \\(PPF\\), of a country, \\(H\\), in autarky in which only two products, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), can be produced and consumed, respectively.\n\nGiven the country is in autarky (that is, no trade), the price relation of both goods within the country is represented by the line denoted with \\(P_{autarky}\\). The indifference curve that represents the utility maximizing level of utility is denoted with \\(IC_{autarky}\\). Mark in the figure how much of both goods are produced and consumed, respectively.\n\nSuppose country \\(H\\) opens up to trade with foreign countries. Further assume that the country can trade with other countries at fixed world market prices\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_W&gt;\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_A,\n\\end{align}\\] where \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_A\\) denotes the price relation of country H in autarky, \\(P_{autarky}\\). Sketch the world market price relation in the figure and mark the new production point on the production possibility frontier curve. Moreover, mark below those statements that are true:\nCountry \\(H\\) will produce more of good \\(x_1\\) than in autarky\nCountry \\(H\\) will produce more of good \\(x_2\\) than in autarky\nCountry \\(H\\) will consume more of good \\(x_1\\) than in autarky\nCountry \\(H\\) will export good \\(x_1\\) and import good \\(x_2\\).\nCountry \\(H\\) will export good \\(x_2\\) and import good \\(x_1\\).\nCountry \\(H\\) will suffer a loss of welfare due to opening up to trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.4 Production and consumption (?sol-gains)\nShow that opening markets to foreign trade can be beneficial for a small economy where only two goods can be produced and consumed. Use a two-way diagram to do this. In particular, show the consumption and production point of the economy in autarky with the corresponding price relation. Then assume that the economy opens up to the foreign market, allowing it to buy goods at world prices that are different from prices in autarky. Show the consumption and production point of the autarkic economy with the corresponding price relation under free trade. Can you outline the higher level of welfare in free trade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAs visualized in Figure 2.10, the indifference curve under free trade lies above the IC under autarky. This reflects the higher utility level under free trade.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Gains from trade",

    "text": "2.4 More trade is not necessarily good (immiserizing growth)\nSo far, I have implicitly assumed that the world market price is fixed and not changed by the entry of country H into the free trade market. When the latter is the case, economists speak of a small open economy (SOE). In general, a SOE is an economy that is so small that its policies do not change world prices.\nSuppose that country H is not an SOE. What would happen to world prices if country H offered a lot of good \\(x_1\\) to receive good \\(x_2\\)? Obviously, \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_W\\) would fall. In the worst case, country H is so large that \\[\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_W=\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_A.\\] This means that country H has no benefits from free trade.\nAssuming that a (large) country cannot opt out from free trade and that the exporting sector grows, there is a theoretical scenario called immiserizing growth that shows that free trade countries are worse off in the long run. This scenario is illustrated in Figure 2.11. The figure summarizes two periods. In the first period, country H produces at point B and consumes at point D, trading goods at world prices \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_W\\). Then country H grows in sector 1. This is shown in the new production possibility curve TK2. If country H were able to trade at the old world price, it would be able to consume at point F. Unfortunately, country H is not a SOE, and therefore world prices (from country H’s perspective) deteriorate to \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_W^{'}\\). This has bad implications for country H, since its optimal consumption is now at point D’, which has lower welfare relative to point D. However, this is not an argument against trade, since the welfare at point D’ is still above the production possibility curve in autarky, TK1.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Immiserizing growth",

    "text": "2.5 The theory of comparative advantage (Ricardian Model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\n\n\n\n\nLess-developed countries can compete in international markets even if they are less productive in producing everything. In other words, opening to trade is beneficial for countries that have an absolute disadvantage in the production of all goods.\nBoth, developed and less-developed countries can gain from international trade.\nSpecialization in production increases the price of exported goods for that country. As a result, prices converge.\nA discussion of national competitiveness is not useful through the lens of the Ricardo theorem.\n\nRecommended reading: Suranovic (2012, Chapter 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: This painting shows Ricardo, aged 49 in 1821.\n\n\n\nSource: National Portrait Gallery\n\n\n\nDavid Ricardo} (1772-1823), one of the most influential economists of his time, had a simple idea that had a major impact on how we think about trade. In Ricardo (1817), he argued that bilateral trade can be a positive-sum game for both countries, even if one country is less productive in all sectors, if each country specializes in what it can produce relatively best.\n\nRicardo, D. (1817). On the principles of political economy and taxation. John Murray.\n1 Actually, strictly speaking, this is not correct, since the original description of the idea can already be found in 1815 in the Essay on the External Corn Trade by Robert Torrens. However, David Ricardo formalized the idea in his 1817 book using a convincing and simple numerical example. For more information on this, as well as a great introduction to the Ricardian model and more, I recommend Suranovic (2012).He introduced the theory of comparative advantage that is still an important corner stone of the modern theory of international trade1 It refers to the ability of one party (an individual, a firm, or a country) to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another party. In other words, it is the ability to produce a product with the highest relative efficiency, given all other products that could be produced. In contrast, an absolute advantage is defined as the ability of one party to produce a particular good at a lower absolute cost than another party.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Comparative advantage: Specialize and exchange\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 2.13, the concept of comparative advantage is quite simple. Two parties can increase their overall productivity by sharing the workload based on their respective comparative advantages. Once they have achieved this increase in productivity, they must agree on how to divide the resulting output. Of course, both parties must benefit compared to a scenario in which they work independently.\n\n2.5.1 Defining absolute and comparative advantages\nA subject (country, household, individual, company) has an absolute advantage in the production of a good relative to another subject if it can produce the good at lower total costs or with higher productivity. Thus, absolute advantage compares productivity across subjects but within an item.\nA subject has a comparative advantage in the production of a good relative to another subject if it can produce that good at a lower opportunity cost relative to another subject.\nLet me explain the idea of the concept of comparative advantage with some examples:\n\nOld and young\nTwo women live alone on a deserted island. In order to survive, they have to do some basic activities like fetching water, fishing and cooking. The first woman is young, strong and educated. The second is older, less agile and rather uneducated. Thus, the first woman is faster, better and more productive in all productive activities. So she has an absolute advantage in all areas. The second woman, in turn, has an absolute disadvantage in all areas. In some activities, the difference between the two is large; in others, it is small. The law of comparative advantage states that it is not in the interest of either of them to work in isolation: They can both benefit from specialization and exchange. If the two women divide the work, the younger woman should specialize in tasks where she is most productive (for example, fishing), while the older woman should focus on tasks where her productivity is only slightly lower (for example, cooking). Such an arrangement will increase overall production and benefit both.\n\n\nThe lawyer’s typist\nThe famous economist and Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson (1915-2009) provided another example in his well-received textbook of economics, as follows: Suppose that in a given city the best lawyer also happens to be the best secretary. However, if the lawyer focuses on the task of being a lawyer, and instead of practicing both professions at the same time, hires a secretary, both the lawyer’s and the secretary’s performance would increase because it is more difficult to be a lawyer than a secretary.2\n2 In the first eight editions the example comprised a male lawyer who was better at typing than his female secretary, but who had a comparative advantage in practising law. In the ninth edition published 1973, both lawyer and secretary were assumed to be female (see Backhouse & Cherrier, 2019). Unfortunately, women are still discriminated against in introductory economics textbooks (see Stevenson & Zlotnik, 2018).\nBackhouse, R. E., & Cherrier, B. (2019). Paul Samuelson, gender bias and discrimination. The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought, 26(5), 1053–1080.\n\nStevenson, B., & Zlotnik, H. (2018). Representations of men and women in introductory economics textbooks. AEA Papers and Proceedings, 108, 180–185.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Autarky: An example of two different persons\nAssume that A and B want to produce and consume \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) respectively. Because of the complementarity of the two goods, each must be consumed in combination with the other. The utility function of both persons is \\(U_{\\{A;B\\}}=min(x,y)\\). Both persons work for 4 time units, that is, their _units of labor} are \\(L_A=L_B=4\\). A needs 1 units of labor to produce one unit of good \\(y\\) and 2 units of labor to produce one unit of good \\(x\\). B needs \\(\\frac{4}{10}=0.4\\) units of labor to produce one unit of good \\(y\\) or good \\(x\\). Thus, their labor input coefficients, which measure the units of labor required by a subject to produce one unit of good, are \\(a^A_y=1, a^A_x=2, a^B_y=0.4, a^B_x=0.4\\):\n\n\n\ninput coefficient (\\(a\\))\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n1\n0.4\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n2\n0.4\n\n\n\nSpending all her time in the production of \\(y\\), A can produce \\(\\frac{L_A}{a_y^A}=\\frac{4}{1}=4\\) units of \\(y\\) and B can produce \\(\\frac{L_B}{a_y^B}=\\frac{4}{0.4}=10\\) units of \\(y\\). Spending all her time in the production of \\(y\\), A can produce \\(\\frac{L_A}{a_x^A}=\\frac{4}{2}=2\\) units of \\(x\\)and B can produce \\(\\frac{L_B}{a_x^B}=\\frac{4}{0.4}=10\\) units of \\(x\\). Knowing this, we can easily draw the production possibility frontier curves (PPF) of person A and B as shown in Figure 2.14.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: The production possibility frontier in autarky\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn autarky, both person maximize their utility: Individual A can consume \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) units of each good and individual B can consume \\(5\\) units of each good. The respective indifference curves are drawn in dashed blue lines in Figure 2.14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.5 Indifference curves for perfect complementary goods\n\nName some real world examples of goods that are perfectly complementary.\nThe blue dashed lines in Figure 2.14 represent the indifference curves of individual A and B. The upward sloping dashed black line is denoted with ``possible consumption path’’. Explain, why is it not correct–in strict sense–to name it like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2.1 Can person A and B improve their maximum consumption with cooperation?\nLet us assume the two persons come together and try to understand how they can improve by jointly deciding which goods they should produce. If we assume that both persons redistribute their joint production so that both have an incentive to share and trade, we can concentrate on the total production output. Their joint PPF curve can then be drawn in two ways:\n\nPerson A specializes in good \\(x\\), then the joint production possibilities are presented in Figure 2.15.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: World PFF, A specializes in \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf A produces only good \\(x\\), as shown in Figure 2.15, we see that A and B can consume a total of 6 units of goods \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This is less in total than in autarky, where A can consume \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) units of each good and person B can consume \\(5\\) units of each good, giving a combined consumption of \\(\\frac{19}{3}=6,\\bar{6}\\).\n\nPerson A specializes in good \\(y\\), then the joint production possibilities are presented in Figure 2.16.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: World PFF, A specializes \\(y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf A produces only good \\(y\\), as shown in Figure 2.16, we see that A and B can consume a total of 7 units of goods \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Thus, both can be better off compared to autarky, since the total quantity distributed is larger. Thus, we have an Pareto improvement here because at least one person can be better off compared to autarky.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: World PFF in autarky when A specialize in producing good \\(y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2.17, the three possible consumption scenarios are marked with a dot and the PPFs of person A specializing in the production of good \\(x\\) (\\(PPF_{A\\rightarrow x}\\)) or good \\(y\\) (\\(PPF_{A\\rightarrow y}\\)) are also drawn. The scenario with person A specializing in the production of good \\(y\\) is the output maximizing solution.\n\n\n2.5.2.2 Optimal production in cooperation\nIn order to produce the most bundles of both goods, the optimal cooperative production is\n\n\n\nproduction in cooperation\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n4\n3\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n0\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2.3 Check for absolute advantage\nEmploying 10 units of labor B can produce more of both goods and hence has an absolute advantage in producing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Formally, we can proof this by comparing the input coefficients of both countries in each good:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabsolute advantage\nA\n\nB\n\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n\\(a_y^A=1\\)\n&gt;\n\\(0.4=a_y^B\\)\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) B has an absolute advantage in good \\(y\\)\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n\\(a_x^A=2\\)\n&gt;\n\\(0.4=a_x^B\\)\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) B has an absolute advantage in good \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2.4 Check for comparative advantage\nThe slope of the PPFs represent the marginal rate of transformation, the terms of trade in autarky and the opportunity costs of a country. The opportunity costs are defined by how much of a good \\(x\\) (or \\(y\\)) a person (or country) has to give up to get one more of good \\(y\\) (or \\(x\\)). For example, A must give up \\(\\frac{a_x^A}{a_y^A}=\\frac{1}{2}=0.5\\) of good \\(x\\) to produce one more of good \\(y\\). Thus, A’s opportunity costs of producing one unit of \\(y\\) is the production foregone, that is, a half good \\(x\\). All opportunity costs of our example are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopportunity costs of producing …\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\n…1 unit of good \\(y\\):\n\\(\\frac{a_y^A}{a_x^A}=\\frac{1}{2}=0.5\\) (good x)\n\\(\\frac{a_y^B}{a_x^B}=\\frac{0.4}{0.4}=1\\) (good x)\n\n\n…1 unit of good \\(x\\):\n\\(\\frac{a_x^A}{a_y^A}=\\frac{2}{1}=2\\) (good y)\n\\(\\frac{a_x^B}{a_y^B}=\\frac{0.4}{0.4}=1\\) (good y)\n\n\n\nPerson A has a comparative advantage in producing good \\(y\\) since A must give up less of good \\(x\\) to produce one unit more of good \\(y\\) than person B must. In turn, Person B has a comparative advantage in producing good \\(x\\) since B must give up less of good \\(y\\) to produce one unit more of good \\(x\\) than person B must give up of good \\(y\\) to produce one unit more of good \\(x\\). Thus, every person has a comparative advantage and if both would specialize in producing the good in which they have a comparative advantage and share their output they can improve their overall output as was shown in Figure 2.17.\nAn alternative and more direct way to see the comparative advantages of A and B, respectively, is by comparing the two input coefficients of A with the two input coefficients of B: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} &\\lesseqqgtr \\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \\quad  \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{2} &lt;\\frac{0.4}{0.4}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, A has a comparative advantage in \\(y\\) and B in \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparative advantage: Definition\nEconomic subjects (e.g., individuals, households, firms, countries) should specialize in the production of that good in which they have a comparative advantage, that is, the ability of an economic subject to carry out a particular economic activity (e.g., producing goods) at a lower opportunity cost than a trade partner.\n\n\\(\\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} &gt; \\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \\Rightarrow\\) country A (B) has a comparative advantage in good x (y)\n\\(\\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} &lt; \\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \\Rightarrow\\) country A (B) has a comparative advantage in good y (x)\n\\(\\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} = \\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \\Rightarrow\\) no country has a comparative advantage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2.5 Trade structure and consumption in cooperation\nIf A specializes in the production of \\(y\\), she must import some of good \\(y\\), otherwise she cannot consume a bundle of both goods as desired. In turn, B wants to import some of the good \\(y\\). B will not accept to consume less than 5 bundles of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) as this was his autarky consumption. Thus, B wants a minimum of 2 units of good \\(y\\) from A. A will not accept to give more than \\(4-\\frac{4}{3}=2\\frac{2}{3}\\) items of good \\(y\\) away and he wants at least \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) items of good \\(x\\). Overall, we can define three trade scenarios:\n\nAll gains from cooperation goes to A (see Figure 2.18 and Table 2.1);\nAll gains from cooperation goes to B (see Table 2.2); or\nThe gains from specialization and trade are shared by A and B with a trade structure between the two extreme scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: : Consumption and trade when all gains from cooperation goes to A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n2\n5\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n2\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Exports and imports of goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n-2\n2\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n2\n-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: : Consumption and trade when all gains from cooperation goes to B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\\(5\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\\(5\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Exports and imports of goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n\\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the three cases yield a Pareto-improvement, that is, none gets worst but at least one gets better by mutually decide on production and redistribute the joint output. In the real world, however, it is often difficult for countries to cooperate and decide mutually on production and consumption. In particular, it is practically difficult to enforce redistribution of the joint outcome so that everyone is better off. So let’s examine whether there is a mechanism that yields trade gains for both trading partners.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: Bilateral trade with one winner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 The Ricardian model\nTo understand the underlying logic of the argument, let us formalize and generalize the situation of two subjects and their choices for production and consumption.\nIn particular, the Ricardian Model build on the following assumptions:\n\n2 subjects (A,B) can produce 2 goods (x,y) with\ntechnologies with constant returns to scale. Moreover,\nproduction limits are defined by \\(y^i Q_y^i+ a_x^i Q_x^i=L^i\\)$, where \\(a^i_j\\) denotes the unit of labor requirement for person \\(i \\in \\{A,B\\}\\) in the production of good \\(j\\in \\{x,y\\}\\) and \\(Q^i_j\\) denotes the quantity of good \\(j\\) produced by person \\(i\\), and \\(Q^i_j\\) the quantity of good \\(j\\) produced by person \\(i\\) and \\(Q^i_j\\) the quantity of good \\(j\\) produced by person \\(i\\). (Imagine they both work 4 hours).\nLet \\(a^i_j\\) denote the so-called labor input coefficients, that is, the units of labor required by a person \\(i \\in \\{A,B\\}\\) to produce one unit of good \\(j\\in \\{x,y\\}\\).\nSuppose further that person B requires fewer units of labor to produce both goods, that is, \\(a^A_y&gt;a^B_y\\) and \\(a^A_x&gt;a^B_x\\), and that\na comparative advantage exists, that is, \\(\\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \\neq \\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRicardian theorem\nIf each country specialize in the production in the good for which it has a comparative advantage and exports this good, both countries gain from trade when the new world market price relation, \\(\\frac{p^*_y}{p^*_x}\\), lies between the price relations of both countries3 \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x}  = \\frac{p^B_y}{p^B_x} &&gt; \\frac{a^*_y}{a^*_x}= \\frac{p^*_y}{p^*_x}&gt; \\frac{p^A_y}{p^A_x} = \\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x}\n\\end{align*}\\] because the consumption possibilities enlarge for both countries compared to a situation with no trade.\n\n\n\n3 In order to see that the relative prices within a country equals the relative productivity parameters, consider that nominal income of labor in producing good \\(j\\in \\{x,y\\}\\), \\(w_jL^i_j\\), must equal the production value, that is, \\(p_j^ix_j^i\\): \\[\n            w_jL^i_j=p_j^ix_j^i.\n            \\] Setting \\(w_j=1\\) as the numeraire and re-arranging the equation, we get \\[\n            p_j^i=\\frac{L_j^i}{x_j^i}=a_j^i.\n            \\] \n\n2.5.4 Distribution of welfare gains\nThe Ricardo theorem tells us nothing about the precise distribution of welfare gains. In this section, I will show that the distribution of welfare gains is the result of relative supply and demand in the world.\nTo illustrate this, consider Ricardo’s famous example4 of two countries (England and Portugal) that can produce cloth \\(T\\) and wine \\(W\\) with different input requirements, namely:\n4 The example is explained by Suranovic (2012) in greater detail.\nSuranovic, S. (2012). International economics: Theory and policy (1.0 ed.). Saylor Foundation. https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/276\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{p^P_W}{p^P_T}=\\frac{a^P_W}{a^P_T}=\\frac{8}{9}&lt;\\frac{12}{10}=\\frac{a^E_W}{a^E_T}= \\frac{p^E_W}{p^E_T}\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, England has an absolute disadvantage in the production of both goods, but England has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth and Portugal has a comparative advantage in the production of wine. Let us further assume that both countries are similarly endowed with labor, \\(\\bar{L}\\). Then we can calculate the world supply of cloth and wine given relative world prices, \\(\\frac{p_T}{p_W}\\). Since we know that Portugal will only produce wine if the price of wine relative to cloth is above \\(\\frac{p_W}{p_T}=\\frac{8}{9}\\) and England will only produce wine if the price of wine relative to cloth is above \\(\\frac{p_W}{p_T}=\\frac{12}{10}\\), we can draw the relative world supply of goods as shown in the left panel of Figure 2.19. Note that \\(\\alpha\\) in the figure means \\(\\frac{1}{a}\\). Similarly, we can draw in the world supply of clothes, shown in the left panel of Figure 2.19.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: World’s relative supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether both countries specialize totally in the production of one good, or only one country does so depends on world demand for both goods at relative prices. Since we know from the Ricardo Theorem that the world market price relation, \\(\\frac{p^{*}_T}{p^{*}_W}\\), must be between the two autarky price relations: \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{p^P_T}{p^P_W}&gt;\\frac{p^{*}_T}{p^{*}_W}&gt; \\frac{p^E_T}{p^E_W}.\n\\end{align}\\] If world demand for cloth would be sufficiently high to have a world price of \\[\\frac{p^P_T}{p^P_W}=\\frac{9}{8}\\] Portugal would not gain from trade. On the contrary, if world demand for wine would be sufficiently high to have a world price of \\[\\frac{p^P_T}{p^P_W}=\\frac{10}{12}\\] England would not gain from trade. Thus, the price span between \\(\\frac{10}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{9}{8}\\) says us which country gains from trade. For example, at a world price of \\[\\frac{p^{*}_T}{p^{*}_W}=1\\] about 57%\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left[\\frac{\\left(1-\\frac{10}{12}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{9}{8}-\\frac{10}{12}\\right)}\\approx 0.57 \\right]\n\\end{align}\\] of the gains through trade will be distributed to Portugal and about 43% will be distributed to England.\nIn Figure 2.20, I show two demand curves of the World. The dashed demand curve represents a world with a relative strong preference on wine and the other demand curve represents a relative strong demand for cloth. Since Portugal has a comparative advantage in producing wine, they would happy to live in a world where demand for wine is relatively high, whereas the opposite holds true for England.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.20: World’s relative supply and demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.6 Comparative advantage and opportunity costs\nAssume that only two countries, A and B, exist. Both countries are equally endowed with labor which is the only production factor. Both countries can produce either good \\(y\\) or good \\(x\\).

Both countries are equally endowed with labor which is the only production factor. Both countries can produce either good \\(y\\) or good \\(x\\). The table below gives the input coefficients, \\(a\\), for both countries, that is, the units of labor needed to produce one unit of good \\(y\\) and good \\(x\\), respectively.\n\n\n\nGood\nCountry A\nCountry B\n\n\n\n\nGood y\n10\n9\n\n\nGood x\n12\n10\n\n\n\nDiscuss absolute and comparative advantages. How much faster does B needs to in producing good \\(y\\) to become an exporter of that good?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logic of opportunity cost is straightforward. You must compare the opportunity costs across countries: If country A wants to produce one more unit of good \\(y\\), it requires 10 units of labor. With these 10 units, it could produce 10/12 = 0.83 units of good \\(x\\) because it requires 12 units of labor to produce 1 unit of good \\(x\\). If country B wants to produce one more unit of good \\(y\\), it requires 9 units of labor. With these 9 units, it could produce 9/10 = 0.9 units of good \\(x\\) because it requires 10 units of labor to produce 1 unit of good \\(x\\). Thus, the opportunity costs of country A are smaller compared to country B in producing good \\(y\\). This is because country A has to give up less production of good \\(x\\) in order to produce 1 more unit of good \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopportunity costs of producing…\nPerson A\nPerson B\n\n\n\n\n…1 unit of good y:\n\\(\\frac{a_y^A}{a_x^A} = \\frac{10}{12} \\approx 0.83\\) (good x)\n\\(\\frac{a_y^B}{a_x^B} = \\frac{9}{10} = 0.9\\) (good x)\n\n\n…1 unit of good x:\n\\(\\frac{a_x^A}{a_y^A} = \\frac{12}{10} = 1.2\\) (good y)\n\\(\\frac{a_x^B}{a_y^B} = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.11\\) (good y)\n\n\n\nThus, A has a comparative advantage in producing good \\(y\\) and B has a comparative advantage in producing good \\(x\\). This seems to be counterintuitive as B can produce faster anything and everybody else.\nWhen looking on input coefficients, we get \\[\n\\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x}=\\frac{10}{12} &lt; \\frac{9}{10}=\\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x}\n\\] which gives us the same comparative advantages as described above.\nTo become an exporter of \\(y\\), B needs to have lower opportunity costs in the production of \\(y\\) than A. This can happen by becoming more productive in producing \\(y\\) and/or by becoming ‘slower’ in producing good \\(x\\) so that \\(\\frac{a_y^B}{a_x^B}&lt;\\frac{10}{12}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.8 Comparative advantage and input coefficients\nAssume that only two countries, A and B, exist.

Bertil Ohlin received the Nobel Prize in 1977 (together with James Meade). The HO-Model, as it is often abbreviated, was the main reason for the price. Here is an excerpt of the Award ceremony speech:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\n\nThe question why individuals, firms and nations exchange goods and services with each other, and how these processes are influenced by government policies, may be regarded as the basic issue in the science of economics. In the case of exchange between countries, the dominating theory was for a long time – from the beginning of the 19th century – David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. Ricardo explained there the structure of foreign trade by differences in the production technology between nations. Over the years the theory was gradually improved upon in various ways, but a more basic overhaul did not take place until Bertil Ohlin in the early 1930’s published his work Interregional and International Trade, which is now a classic, and James Meade in the 1950’s came out with his important volumes on The Theory of International Economic Policy.\nBertil Ohlin showed in this work, which to some extent was inspired by a remarkable article by Eli Heckscher, that foreign trade may arise even if the production technology were identical in different nations. It is enough that the supplies of the factors of production of various kinds – such as labor of different types, capital, and land – differ among nations. The starting point of Ohlin’s theory is that a country tends to be an exporter of commodities that use relatively large amounts of the factors of production which are in ample supply as compared to domestic demand – in the hypothetical case without foreign trade. For instance, to take a simple example, if land is abundant in Australia while labor is relatively plentiful in England, we would expect Australia to be an exporter of commodities which for their production require much land, such as wool, while England would be an exporter of commodities the production of which requires relatively much labor, such as textiles.\nFrom this simple theoretical structure, the so-called Heckscher-Ohlin model, follow a number of interesting theorems. One of them, the factor price equalization theorem, tells us that foreign trade tends to equalize the prices of the factors of production in different countries. For instance, when Australia starts to export land-intensive goods, the demand for land goes up relative to labor, with a rise in land prices as a result, while the export of labor-intensive goods by England pulls up wages there relative to the price of land. Thus, trade in commodities tends to have the same effects on the prices of the factors of production as if the factors themselves could move freely between countries. In this sense, commodity trade is a substitute for international mobility of the factors of production. Another inference from Ohlin’s theory is that a tariff on a labor-intensive good, such as textiles, affects the distribution of income in favor of labor in the importing country, while a tariff on a capital-intensive commodity, such as wool or steel, results in an income redistribution in favor of the owner of capital.\nSource: www.nobelprize.org\n\n\n\n\nThe Ricardo model explains international trade as advantageous because of comparative advantages that are the result of technological differences. This means that comparative advantage in the Ricardian model is solely the result of productivity differences. The size of a country or the size of the countries’ endowments does not matter for comparative advantage in the Ricardian model because there is only one factor of production in Ricardian models, namely labor. However, the assumption that there is only one factor of production is unrealistic, and we should ask what happens if there is more than one factor of production but no productivity differences? What happens if the two factors are available differently in different countries? What is the significance of endowment differences for international trade? And which owner of a factor of production will be a winner when a country opens up to world trade, and who will lose? The HO model can provide answers to these questions.\nIn Table 2.3, I show that countries do indeed differ substantially in their total factor productivity, capital stock, and labor endowments, which are likely correlated with total population.\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Endowment differences across countries in 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegionCode\nCapital stock at current PPPs (in mil. 2011USD)\nPopulation (in millions)\nCapital stock per capita\n\n\n\n\nITA\n10421041\n60\n174885\n\n\nESP\n7806612\n47\n167518\n\n\nFRA\n10405968\n65\n160395\n\n\nGBR\n9973122\n63\n159019\n\n\nDEU\n12687682\n80\n157738\n\n\nUSA\n48876336\n310\n157729\n\n\nAUS\n3332890\n22\n150382\n\n\nCAN\n5065392\n34\n148431\n\n\nJPN\n17161376\n127\n134790\n\n\nSAU\n3716382\n28\n132300\n\n\nKOR\n6052155\n49\n123287\n\n\nTWN\n2835890\n23\n122549\n\n\nROU\n1271652\n20\n62647\n\n\nVEN\n1765996\n29\n60905\n\n\nBRA\n9869311\n199\n49691\n\n\nRUS\n6746460\n143\n47126\n\n\nPOL\n1769004\n39\n45859\n\n\nTHA\n2977965\n67\n44652\n\n\nIRN\n3234132\n74\n43555\n\n\nARG\n1773984\n41\n43034\n\n\nMEX\n5054693\n119\n42613\n\n\nTUR\n2938288\n72\n40634\n\n\nUKR\n1616826\n46\n35420\n\n\nIDN\n8146254\n242\n33716\n\n\nCOL\n1446480\n46\n31501\n\n\nCHN\n42218080\n1341\n31483\n\n\nPER\n681036\n29\n23185\n\n\nPHL\n1560017\n93\n16767\n\n\nIRQ\n443733\n31\n14375\n\n\nIND\n15356803\n1231\n12475\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Penn World Tables 9.0\n\n\n2.6.2 The Heckscher-Ohlin (factor proportions) model\nAssumptions:\n\nTwo countries: Home country and foreign country. Variables referring to foreign countries are marked with an asterisk, \\(*\\).\nTwo goods: \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nTwo factors of production: \\(K\\) and \\(L\\). This is new in relation to the Ricarkian model! Let’s name the factors \\(K\\) and \\(L\\), which stands for capital and labor.\nGoods differ in terms of their need for factors of production: \\[\\frac{K_y}{L_y} \\neq \\frac{K_x}{L_x}.\\] This means that one good must be produced in a capital-intensive way and the other in a labor-intensive way. If we assume that good \\(y\\) is capital intensive and good \\(x\\) is labor intensive in production, we can write: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{K_y}{L_y} &gt; \\frac{K_x}{L_x}.\n\\end{align*}\\] In this inequality, the quantity of capital required to produce good \\(y\\), \\(K_y\\), is on the left-hand side relative to the quantity of labor required to produce good \\(y\\), \\(L_y\\), that is, the capital intensity of good \\(y\\).The capital intensity of good \\(x\\) is on the right-hand side of the inequality. Rewriting this inequality, we can express it in terms of labor intensities: \\(\\frac{L_y}{K_y} &lt; \\frac{L_x}{K_x}.\\) It should be clear that both inequalities say the same thing.\nNo technology differences between countries: Since we already know from Ricardian theory that productivity or technology differences are a source of international trade, we do not want to explain the same thing again with the HO model. So we assume that all input coefficients are the same in all countries.\nDifferent relative factor endowments: \\[\\frac{K}{L} \\neq \\frac{K^*}{L^*}.\\] Since countries are assumed to have different factor endowments, the model links a country’s trade pattern to its endowment of factors of production. The capital-labor ratio in the home country, \\(\\frac{K}{L}\\), must differ from the ratio abroad. Suppose the home country is capital-rich and the foreign country is labor-rich. Then we have the following ratios between capital and labor in the two countries: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{K}{L} &gt; \\frac{K^*}{L^*}.\n\\end{align*}\\] This means that the capital-labor ratio (a country’s capital intensity) is higher in the home country than abroad. In terms of the ratio between labor and capital, that is, the labor intensity of a country, this can be expressed as follows: \\(\\frac{L}{K} &lt; \\frac{L^*}{K^*}.\\) It should be clear that both inequalities say the same thing.\nFree factor movement between sectors Both factors can be used in the production of both goods. Note that cross-country movement of factors (migration, foreign direct investment) is not allowed.\nNo trade costs Final products can be traded without any costs.\nEqual tastes in countries and homothetic preferences Consumers in both countries have the same utility function. Homothetic preferences simply mean that for given relative prices, income does not affect the ratio of consumption.\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Heckscher-Ohlin theorem\n\nConsider that the home country has relatively more capital and the foreign country relatively more labor and that the good \\(y\\) is capital intensive in production whereas the good \\(x\\) is labor intensive.\nThen it is relatively cheap for the home country to produce the capital-intensive good because it is endowed with a lot of capital, while it is relatively costly to produce the good with which the country is hardly endowed.\n\nThus, the home country has a comparative advantage in producing the capital-intensive good.\nThe opposite is true for the foreign country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeckscher-Ohlin Theorem\n\n\n\nThe capital abundant country exports the capital-intensive good. The labor abundant country exports the labor-intensive good.\nIn other words:\nA country export goods that are intensive in its relatively abundant factor and will import goods that are intensive in its relatively scarce factor.\n\n\n\n\n2.6.4 Factor-price equalization theorem\n\nAs a result of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, output of the good in which the country has a comparative advantage would increase. The capital intensive country will produce more capital intensive goods and the labor intensive country will produce more labor intensive goods.\nAs the production of the good that makes intensive use of the abundant resource increases, the demand for that resource will also increase. Demand for the scarce resource will also increase, but to a lesser extent.\nIf production of the good that intensively uses the scarce resource decreases, both abundant and scarce resources will be released, but relatively more of the scarce resource than of the abundant resource.\nIn autarky, the relatively scarce factor in the home country was labor and factor prices were as follows: \\[\n      \\frac{w}{r}&gt;\\frac{w^*}{r^*}\n\\]\nAfter opening to trade, production shifts to the home country so that the wage falls (\\(w\\downarrow\\)) and the rent rises (\\(r\\uparrow\\)).\nAfter opening to trade, production shifts abroad so that the wage rises, \\(w^*\\uparrow\\), and the rent falls, \\(w^*\\downarrow\\).\nThis reallocation process, and hence the change in factor prices, continues until factor prices are equal in all countries: \\[\n      \\frac{w}{r}=\\frac{w^*}{r^*}\n\\]\n\nFigure 2.23 visualizes the reasoning behind the factor-price equalization theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor-price equalization theorem\n\n\n\nThe prices of the two factors of production (wage and rent) will be equalized across countries as a result of international trade in goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.23: HO Model and factor prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI recommend a clip of Mike Moore explaining how trade based on factor endowments affects wages and returns to capital, see this video:\n\n\n\nWhy does the Factor-Price Equalization Theorem not (fully) hold?\nIn the real world, factor prices do not equalize due to frictions such as transportation costs, trade barriers, and the presence of goods that are rarely or never traded.\nTrade as an alternative to factor movements:\nThe factor price equalization theorem contains an interesting insight: if a country allows free trade in its products, it will automatically export the abundant factor indirectly in the form of goods that intensively use the abundant factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.14 Ricardo and Heckscher-Ohlin\n\nDiscuss the main differences of the Ricardian Model and the Heckscher-Ohlin Model.\nAssume that only two countries, A and B, exist. Both countries are equally endowed with the only production factor labor which can be used to produce either good \\(y\\) or good \\(x\\). The table below gives input coefficients, \\(a\\), for both countries, that is, the units of labor needed to produce one unit of good \\(y\\) and good \\(x\\), respectively.

Moreover, assume the factor intensity of production as stated in the assumptions above.\n\nSketch the production frontiers for both countries in autarky. Show graphically the relative price in autarky.\nYou will see that the relative prices of goods differ across countries: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)\\neq\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)^*.\n\\end{align*}\\] That means, the Home country A has a comparative advantage in producing good \\(1\\).\nNow, sketch the world market price that will maximize the utility.\nWhere are the new production and consumption points of both countries?\nShow in the graphic how much each country trades.\nI recommend a clip of Mike Moore who also explains the HO-Model with production possibility curves, see this video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.24: HO-Model in one figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo identical countries (A and B) have different initial factor endowments. I assume that country A is abundantly endowed with the production factor that is intensively used in the production of good 1, the reverse holds for country B. Thus, the two solid black lines in Figure 2.24 represents the respective production possibility frontier curves. The orange lines represents the respective indifference curves. Autarky equilibria are marked with \\(A^{A}\\) and \\(A^{B}\\), respectively. The production points in trade equilibrium are marked with \\(P^A\\) and \\(P^B\\), the consumption point of both countries is in \\(C^A=C^B\\). Thus, production and consumption points are divergent. The indifference curve under free trade is clearly above the other indifference curve in autarky. The solid black line that is tangient to the consumption point under free trade represents the utility maximizing world market price under free trade.

    "text": "2.7 The specific factor model\n\n\n\nFigure 2.25: Not everybody wins with free trade\n\n\n\nSource: otherwords.org\n\n\n\nFrom the Ricardian model, we know that trade is a positive-sum game. If free trade is beneficial to a country, as Ricardo predicts, why isn’t everyone happy with free trade? In democratic societies, policymakers sometimes adopt protectionist trade policies because of pressure from interest groups and public demand. The discrepancy between the promises and potential benefits of trade on the one hand and the negative consequences of free trade for many groups on the other is illustrated in Figure 2.25. The models so far do not give us a way to see which groups actually suffer from free trade, and thus we have no clue why there are incentives for interest groups to oppose free trade. Are anti-free trade policy preferences the result of ignorance, general worldviews, political ideology, environmental attitudes, social trust, or other factors? Well, these things may play a role, but there are also economic factors, that is, the self-interest of individuals and groups within an economy, that can account for anti-free trade attitudes. In the following sections, we will discuss a theory that shows that while free trade benefits countries as a whole, not everyone within a country benefits equally. Some benefit more than others, and some are actually made worse off by free trade.\nIn the next two subsections, we derive some key hypotheses that free trade favors those people in a country who have abundant factors of production and disadvantages those who have scarce factors. Moreover, free trade favors investors and workers in export-oriented industries with comparative advantages.\n\n2.7.0.1 Assumptions\nThe sector-specific model, also known as the Ricard-Viner model, can show that there are winners and losers in international trade. The model is based on the following assumptions:\n\n2 countries \\(i \\in \\{A, B\\}\\)\n2 goods (sectors) \\(g \\in \\{1, 2\\}\\)\n3 factors of production: Labor \\(L\\), capital specific to the production of good 1, \\(K_1\\), and capital specific to the production of good 2, \\(K_2\\)5. The technologies for the production of both goods are now represented by two production functions \\(Q_1=F_1(\\bar{K_1},L_1)\\) and \\(Q_2=F_2(\\bar{K_2},L_2)\\), where both factors of production have positive but decreasing marginal products\nThe capital allocated to each sector is fixed for both countries: \\(K_1=\\bar{K}_{1}, K_2=\\bar{K}_{2}\\)\nThe labor assigned to each sector (\\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\)) can change in response to external shocks: \\(\\bar{L}=L_1+L_2\\)\nperfect competition\nperfect market clearing (no unemployment)\ncountry A is a small open economy (we consider only country A and therefore do not use a subscript for countries in the following)\n\n5 You can think of capital specific to the production of manufacturing goods (good 1) and land specific to the production of food sector goods (good 2)\n\n2.7.0.2 The production possibility frontier with two factor inputs:\nThe two production functions, the fixed endowments and the distribution of labor determine the aggregate PPF. The PPF, which is the product of two production functions (\\(F_1\\) and \\(F_2\\)), is shown in Figure 2.26. The figure shows, for both production points A and B, how the mobile factor of production, labor, must be reallocated from sector 2 to sector 1 in order to produce more of good 1 in production point B. The second and fourth quadrants show the respective production functions of sectors 1 and 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.26: PPF with two factors and positive but declining marginal products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.0.3 Equillibrium in autarky:\n\nDepending on a country’s demand for good 1 and 2 a production point on the PPF is chosen at which it must hold that the slope of the PPF curve and the price relation (that is, relation of marginal product of labor in sector 1 and sector 2) must be equal: \\[\\begin{align*}\n          \\frac{p_1}{p_2}=\\frac{\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial L_2}}{\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial L_1}}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWhat can we say about the rents of the production factors?\nFrom the assumption of perfect competition it follows that firms do not make a positive profit in equilibrium, \\(\\pi\\overset{!}{=}0\\). Thus, the equilibrium wage for sectors \\(g \\in \\{1, 2\\}\\) are given by the profit maximizing of firms \\[\\begin{align*}\n          \\pi_g&=p_g\\cdot F_g(\\bar{K_g},L_g)-w_gL_g-r_gK_g\\\\\n          \\frac{\\partial \\pi_g}{\\partial L_g}&= p_g\\cdot \\frac{\\partial F_g}{\\partial L_g}-w_g\\overset{!}{=}0 \\qquad\n          \\Leftrightarrow w_g=p_g\\frac{\\partial F_g}{\\partial L_g}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWe know that labor can move freely between sectors and an equilibrium exists when there are no incentives to move any further. That is the case when wages in both sectors are equal, \\(w_1=w_2\\). Thus, we can express wages in terms of purchasing power in units of good 1 as follows: \\[\\begin{align*}\n          w_1&=p_1\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial L_1}\\qquad \\text{ and } \\qquad w_2=p_2\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial L_2}\\\\\n          \\Rightarrow w&=p_1\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial L_1}=p_2\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial L_2}\\\\\n          \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{w}{p_1}&=\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial L_1}\\\\\n          \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{w}{p_2}&=\\frac{\\partial F_2}{\\partial L_2}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFigure 2.27 presents the equilibrium wage and the optimal allocation of labor into sector 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.27: Equilibrium with two sectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.0.4 Equilibrium under free trade:\nAssume the price of good 1 and good 2 increase due to a trade opening in the same proportion. What happens with the real wage and the real incomes of capital-1 and capital-2 owners? The answer is: no real changes occur.\n\nThe wage rate, \\(w\\), rises in the same proportion as the prices, so the real wages are unaffected. In Figure 2.27 this can be shown by shifting both curves upward.\nThe real incomes of capital owners also remain the same because there will be no reallocation of labor across sectors.\n\nNow, assume only the price of good 1 rises for 10% while \\(p_2\\) remains fixed, \\(\\frac{p'_1}{p_2}&gt;\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\). What happens with the real wage and the real incomes of capital-1 and capital-2 owners? The answer is: some win, some lose, and some maybe win.\n\n\n2.7.0.5 Wages:\n\n\\(p_1\\frac{\\partial F_1}{\\partial L_1}\\) rises and hence labor reallocates from sector 2 to sector 1 (\\(L_1\\uparrow\\) and \\(L_2\\downarrow\\)). This is shown in Figure 2.28.\nThis reallocation of labor has some implications for the real wages measured in purchasing power of good 1 and 2, respectively:\nThe price of good 1 has increased by 10%, the wage has however increased by less than 10% (compare the length of BC and BD in the figure), whereas the price for food stays constant.\nThus, the purchasing power in buying good 2 increased, whereas the purchasing power in buying good 1 decreased. Hence, workers gain when buying good 2 but lose when buying good 1\nOverall, the welfare effect from real wages is unclear and depends on preferences.\n\n\n\n2.7.0.6 Owner of capital-1:\n\nOwners of capital-1 receive a 10% higher price on their products but have to pay a less than 10% higher wage.\nOverall, capital-1 owners gain from free trade because they can employ more workers (at a higher price) now.\n\n\n\n2.7.0.7 Owner of capital-2:\n\nOwner of capital-2 receive the same price on their products but have to pay a higher wage.\nOverall, capital-2 owners lose from free trade because they can employ less workers at a higher price now.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.28: Equilibrium when one price changes",

    "text": "3.1 Political arguments for trade restrictions\nIn this chapter, we discuss countries’ incentives and opportunities to influence trade flows and the welfare implications of trade policy. In particular, we provide information on how the World Trade Organization organizes the world trading system.\nLike most things in real life, trade is never all good or all evil. There are arguments in favor of opening up foreign markets and promoting international cooperation, but there are also plausible arguments that justify restricting international trade. Very often it is an empirical question as to which line of argumentation dominates.\nWhen politicians and interest groups debate the pros and cons of trade, we must be aware of the unfortunate circumstance that not everything that is plausible is logically correct or empirically dominant. Below I will discuss some plausible arguments in favor of trade restrictions. The list is incomplete. Each argument is a topic in itself, and it needs to be further investigated whether these arguments are really valid arguments in favor of trade restrictions.",

    "text": "3.1.1 The desire to reduce domestic unemployment\nAs we learned in the previous sections, the domestic production is the result of the world market price in the long-run. However, in the short run this means that production factors need to reallocate from one sector to the other. So far, we assumed that this reallocation happens without any frictions. Thus, we just moved along the PPF curve. In reality the transformation process is costly because the people loose their jobs without finding a job in another sector instantaneously without any costs. In reality a transformation process comes along with costs such as social costs and search and matching costs. Thus, it can be a rational strategy to decrease the reallocation/transformation pressure in order to organize the reallocation of productions factors properly holding the external negative effects of transformation low. Nevertheless, we should not forget that (in the long run) reallocation of production factors and the adaption of new technologies is basically one of the most important sources of welfare growth, if not the only source.\n\n\n3.1.2 The key enabling technology argument\nIf domestic industries are fostered, there might be technological spillovers to other industries in the country. As the government internalizes these spillovers, they have an incentive to protect and support these key to growth industries and technologies, respectively.\n\n\n3.1.3 The need to counteract dumping in international trade\nSelling goods in a foreign market below the price charged domestically can be called dumping. This sort of price competition is harmful when foreign producers hamper competition and discourage innovation and upgrading. For example, predatory dumping can give arguments for anti-dumping policy interventions. Predatory dumping is a type of anti-competitive behavior in which a foreign company prices its products below market value in an attempt to drive out domestic competition. This may lead to conditions where the company has a monopoly in a certain product or industry in the targeted market with bad implications for social welfare.\n\n\n3.1.4 The government revenue argument\nGovernment can finance their budget by raising tariffs.\n\n\n3.1.5 The national defense argument\nNational defense is an obviously legitimate goal for any sovereign government and hence, domestic industries that supply goods and services that are important for a potential military emergency should have a special protection.\n\n\n3.1.6 The wish to decrease the national balance of payments deficit\nCountries that have a large trade deficit wish – for whatever reason (see Section 1.3}) – to increase import restrictions in order to decrease the export deficit.\n\n\n3.1.7 The income redistribution argument\nAs we have learned, trade generates winners and losers and hence is a source for the distribution of wealth. Government can use this knowledge to redistribute income or decrease income inequality. However, it is almost certain that this politic is not the most efficient and best way to achieve the said goals because we have also learned that trade is beneficial for a country as a whole.\n\n\n3.1.8 The infant industry argument\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The infant industry argument\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic idea is that no economic activities will happen in industries in which there are no possibilities to make positive profits because competition from abroad is currently to strong. A finite protection from international competition can make firms to grow and become more productive so that they can face foreign competition after the protection is abolished. The core of the argument is that infant industries do not have economies of scale like competitors from abroad and, hence, need to be protected until they can attain similar economies of scale.\nFigure 3.1 provides a visualization that may help to understand the infant industry argument. In the left panel you see that the domestic supply curve lies above the world market price, \\(P^W\\). Thus, the domestic industry is not competitive enough to produce at costs lower than the world market price. A tariff in time \\(t\\) would protect the domestic market so that some firms start to produce and sell their goods at home. The hope of the government now is that the firms become more productive over time and in turn their supply curve shifts downwards. The downward shifted supply curve in time \\(t+1\\) is shown in the right panel. Here, the government can remove the tariff without crowding out the domestic production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.1 Arguments for trade restrictions (Solution 3.1)\nExplain briefly (2-3 sentences) the infant industry argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.1. Arguments for trade restrictions (Exercise 3.1)\nA finite protection from international competition can make firms to grow and become more productive so that they can face foreign competition after the protection is abolished. The core of the argument is that infant industries do not have economies of scale like competitors from abroad and, hence, need to be protected until they can attain similar economies of scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.2 Buy local be happy?\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Biden and “BUY AMERICAN”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many countries, including the U.S. (see Figure 3.2), people tend to believe that it is better to buy at home than abroad. A Statement of The White House on July 28, 2021 says:\n\n“The President believes that when we spend American taxpayers’ dollars, it should support American workers and businesses. In his first week in office, President Biden signed Executive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America’s Workers, launching a whole-of-government initiative to strengthen the use of federal procurement to support American manufacturing.’’\n\nThere are intuitive reasons to think that way. However, there are also some logical and persuasive arguments that confront that point of view. Please read the following quotes and discuss whether or not buying locally can be a welfare-enhancing strategy.\nThe first excerpt is entitled with 15 Reasons to Buy American Made Products and stems from www.buydirectusa.com:\n\nNext time you are in a store or shopping online look for the Made in USA label. The job you save by doing so could one day be your own!\n\nWhen you buy American products you support American workers. Existing jobs are saved and more employment opportunities are created.\nWhen you buy American Made products you support companies that are doing business in America.\nHundreds of major American corporations are continuing to ship thousands of jobs overseas. Displacing the American worker.\nSince 2000. the United States has lost an incredible 32% of its manufacturing jobs.\nTo prevent more of our manufacturing cities all over America from being transformed from thriving communities into crime infested hellholes. What happened to Flint, MI and Camden, NJ can happen in any American city when corporations decide to move production overseas.\nChina is now the number one supplier of components that are critical to the operation of US defense systems. Does this bother anyone else?\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute The economy has been unable to create jobs due to America’s massive trade deficit.\nU.S. trade policies encourage businesses to relocate production of goods to other nations without penalizing them for selling those goods back to the United States. This has resulted in millions of lost jobs for the American people.\nSince 1975, the US has imported more goods than it has exported. In 2010, the US had a deficit of $478 billion in global trade.\nOver 30 years of trade policies such as NAFTA and CAFTA have taken jobs from the American people.\nFor every $1 billion in goods imported, the economy loses 9,000 jobs.\nNo regulation or safety standards in products made overseas. Chinese-made drywall used in US homes is creating health and safety hazards.\nMoral implications of the exploitation of foreign workers and violations of child labor laws overseas.\nEnvironmental standards are minimal or non existent in how products are made overseas. This has an impact on everyone on the planet.\nChinese imports accounted for more than 60% of the recalls announced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 2007\n\nUPDATE\n\nCOVID – Where did that get released from?\nWhen you buy products from the CCP, you are helping to fund their military which are a growing threat around the globe.\nYou don’t have to swim to get the products you need.\n\n\nThe second quote stems from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (2002, p. 16) who try to de-mystify the intuition of the buy local propagandists using a lot of data and some logical arguments of which you can read one here:\n\n“A common myth is that it’s better for Americans to spend their money at home than abroad. The best way to expose the fallacy in this argument is to take it to its logical extreme. If it’s better for me to spend my money here than abroad, then it’s even better to buy in Texas than in New York, better yet to buy in Dallas than in Houston… in my own neighborhood… within my own family… to consume only what I can produce. Alone and poor.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas. (2002). The fruits of free trade [Annual Report].",

    "text": "3.3 World Trade Organization\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: The World Trade Organization (WTO)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) (see Figure 3.9) is an intergovernmental organization that regulates international trade and replaced in 1995 the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 164 (!) countries are currently member of the WTO. The WTO facilitates the smooth and free flow of global trade through the administration and monitoring of a rules-based system that should among others help to make international trade (policy) more predictable. This set of rules is embodied in the WTO Agreements which are based on basic principles, that are described in the following three sub-sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: The World Trade Organization (WTO) - Explained With Maps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1 Non-discrimination:\n\n3.3.1.1 The Most Favoured Nation rule (MFN)\nThe MFN ensures non-discrimination between trading partners as it states that if a WTO member grants a country an advantage, it has to give such advantage to all WTO members. Thus, a WTO member has to grant the most favorable conditions under which it allows trade in a certain product type to all other WTO members. However, there is no rule without an exceptions.1\n1 For example, a member may provide preferential treatment only to some countries within a free trade area or customs union, without having to extend such better treatment to all members. Another exception enables developed members to give unilateral preferential treatment to goods imported from developing countries and least-developed countries (LDCs), without having to extend such better treatment to other members.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: E-Learning short videos - Most-favoured nation (MFN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1.2 The National Treatment Principle (NTP)\nThe NTP ensures non-discrimination between domestic and foreign products or services. It prohibits a member from favoring its domestic products over imported products. The NTP aims to provide equality of competitive conditions for imported products in relation to domestic products. Again, no rule without exceptions.2\n2 For example, there may be a security need to develop and purchase products domestically, or government procurement may, as is often the case, be used as a policy tool to promote smaller business, local industry or advanced technologies, see GATT Article III:8(a).\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch:\n\n\n\nE-Learning short videos - General Exceptions\n\n\nE-Learning short videos - The National Treatment Principle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Transparency\nAll WTO members must publish their trade regulations and changes therein. Moreover, members should respond to requests for information by other members.\n\n\n3.3.3 More open and predictable trade\nWhile the use of tariffs and quotas is not prohibited, members have committed to carry out multilateral negotiations periodically with a view to reduce the general level of trade barriers.",

    "text": "3.4 Trade anecdotes\n\n3.4.1 The Dispute Settlement Body\nTo make decisions on trade disputes between governments that are adjudicated by the organization, the WTO has established the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The Dispute Settlement Body is a meeting of the WTO General Council that brings together all representatives of WTO member governments, usually at the ambassador level. Any WTO member that believes another member is in violation of an obligation or WTO rule can file a complaint. The goal of the Dispute Settlement Body is then to find a solution to the dispute, including any violation. The first step is consultations between governments. If the dispute cannot be resolved through discussions, the DSB makes a decision and the offending country is ordered to correct its policies. In most cases, countries find a mutually acceptable solution to the dispute. If the offending country does not correct its policy or provide other compensation, the WTO authorizes retaliatory action by the complaining country against the offending country. The adjudication process can take some time, as can the implementation of remedies to enforce or compensate for the violation of a WTO rule. Figure 3.10 provides an overview of the average number of active, that is, unresolved, complaints in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp-to-date sources of information\n\n\n\n\nBook about trade disputes from 1995 to 2020: Organization (2010): WTO Dispute Settlement: One-page Case Summaries 1995–2020.\nWTO landing page about Dispute settlement\nMap of disputes between WTO Members\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Average annual number of active proceedings per month 1995-2018\n\n\n\nNote: Annual averages are calculated on the basis of the number of active proceedings per month (January to December) over the yearly period concerned (e.g. in 2017, 39 proceedings were active per month, on average).

As Figure 3.12, Figure 3.14, and Figure 3.13 show, the US was the respondent in a relatively high proportion of all issued panel reports, namely in 38% of them (78 out 207). However, this high rate of US participation as respondent to complaints on trade violations is still much lower than its share in suspension requests. In the years I reviewed, there were 75 complainants that prevailed over the US. These are the cases where there is a potential for suspension requests in case of non-compliance. Indeed, 26 of these complainants ended up submitting suspension request against the US. That corresponds to 34.6% of the total. In other words, more than one third of the complainants who prevailed over the US in dispute settlement procedures, were forced to turn to trade sanctions in their effort to obtain compliance by the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuspension requests are…\n\n\n\n\n\n…the “last station” on the long winding road of the WTO dispute settlement procedures and they represent the targeted member state’s unwillingness to submit to the system and to respect its international obligations.\n\n\n\nWhen China acceded to the WTO, many scholars and policy makers were very skeptical about the willingness and ability of China to comply with international trading rules. However, the number of suspension requests that have been filed against China is zero (at the time when Reich (2017) published his study). China’s record on compliance, at least for now and at least as measured by the number of suspension requests filed against it, seems to be perfect.\n\nReich, A. (2017).

The deal will cover nearly 28% of global trade.\nThe Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was signed over a video link on November 15th after eight years of negotiations.\nThe deal sets the terms of trade in goods and services, cross-border investment and new rules for increasingly important areas such as electronic commerce and intellectual property. The effect on the trade of finished goods between Asian nations will be particularly marked, analysts have said.\nTrade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the US and China, in which the two superpowers have imposed billions of dollars’ worth of punitive tariffs on each other’s exports.\nUnlike the CPTPP – the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership – and the EU, it does not establish unified standards on labor and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies.\nDonald Trump in 2017 pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal previously envisaged as a way of curbing China’s influence.\n\n\n3.4.3 Trade dispute between the USA and the European Union\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: Trade wars: How they work and who they impact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2021, President Biden has signed a deal to end tariffs on steel imports from the EU, which were imposed by his predecessor Donald Trump. But the agreement does not cover exports from the UK, putting British steelmakers at a disadvantage as is discussed in an article of the BBC, see UK steel makers ‘left behind’ as US ends trade war.\nIn June 2018, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on € 6.4 billion worth of European steel and aluminum exports, followed by additional tariffs in January 2020 affecting approximately € 40 million worth of EU exports of certain steel and aluminum derivatives. The EU imposed countervailing measures on € 2.8 billion worth of U.S. exports to the EU in June 2018 (a similar EU response followed the second set of U.S. tariffs in 2020). The remaining countervailing measures, affecting up to € 3.6 billion worth of exports, were scheduled to take effect on June 1, 2021. The EU suspended these measures until December 1, 2021, to allow the parties to work together on a longer-term solution. Following today’s announcement by the U.S., these measures will not be imposed. (see European Commission, 2021)\n\nEuropean Commission. (2021). EU and US agree to start discussions on a global arrangement on sustainable steel and aluminium and suspend steel and aluminium trade disputes (Press Release IP/21/5721).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.17: Biden and von der Leyen on G20 leaders’ summit in Rome, October 31\n\n\n\nSource: REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\n\n\nIn November 2021, President Biden has signed a deal to end tariffs on steel imports from the EU, which were imposed by his predecessor Donald Trump. But the agreement does not cover exports from the UK, putting British steelmakers at a disadvantage as is discussed in an article of the BBC, see UK steel makers ‘left behind’ as US ends trade war.\n\n\n3.4.4 Boeing vs. Airbus\nBoeing has continually protested over launch aid in the form of credits to Airbus, while Airbus has argued that Boeing receives illegal subsidies through military and research contracts and tax breaks. All that yielded litigation at the WTO and a series of decisions that allowed (trade) penalties of both sides.\nFor example, on 2 October 2019, the WTO approved US tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods, and officially authorized them on 14 October, despite the European Union urging for a negotiated settlement. On 30 September 2020, however, the WTO approved the European Union’s retaliatory tariffs on $4.1 billion worth of US goods, this is in addition to the previous unimplemented sanction allowing the EU the right to impose tariffs of up to $8.2 billion on US goods and services\nThis is a trade war where nobody will probably be better of in the end. For more details on this dispute, I recommend reading the Wikipedia entry.\nOn June 15, 2021, the U.S. and the EU achieved a major breakthrough in the trade dispute between Boeing and Airbus, agreeing to end the 17-year dispute. All tariffs were suspended for five years.\n\n\n3.4.5 Trump vs. the European Union (a.k.a. Jean-Claude Juncker)\nUnder president Trump, United States imposed tariffs on goods such as cars, olives, single malt whiskey, pecorino cheese, and wine. The EU, in turn, has raised tariffs on goods such as orange juice, bourbon, peanut butter, power boats, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. This escalation was brought to a halt on July 25, 2020, Jean-Claude Junker and Donald J. Trump met at the White House to discuss the ongoing trade dispute, see Figure 3.18. They announced that the United States and the European Union would work to reduce tensions created by Trump’s confrontational trade policies in the past. Before that meeting they made their standpoints clear as paraphrased below.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.18: Juncker and Trump made a deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald J. Trump wrote via Twitter on March 3, 2018:\n\n“The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our very stupid trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!”\n\nJean-Claude Juncker said on March 2 (see euronews.com):\n\n“So now we will also impose import tariffs. This is basically a stupid process, the fact that we have to do this. But we have to do it. We will now impose tariffs on motorcycles, Harley Davidson, on blue jeans, Levis, on Bourbon. We can also do stupid. We also have to be this stupid.”\n\nDonald J. Trump wrote via Twitter on March 3, 2018:\n\n“If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.6 Trump and the WTO\nRead the following excerpt of an article entitled with “Trump Trade Fight Heads to Global Court as WTO Nears the Rubicon” by Bryce Baschuk at www.bloomberg.com published on 21. of November 2018:\n\nThe Geneva-based WTO has long avoided this politically fraught confrontation, which could irreparably harm the organization tasked with deciding international trade disputes. But barring any unforeseen developments, the WTO on Nov. 21 will grant requests from members including China and the European Union to determine if U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in March – and based on national security concerns – are legal.\nU.S. trade officials say that the WTO has no authority to mediate national security matters and should simply issue a decision that says the matter is outside of the WTO’s remit. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo has gone so far as to warn countries against taking this dispute to the WTO, arguing that it instead “requires conversation at the highest political level.” The fight could end up sidelining the WTO.\n“If the WTO finds that Trump’s tariffs are permitted under the national security exception, it opens a gaping hole that would allow any other country the right to impose trade barriers on any product at any moment and for no particular reason other than protectionism” Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview.\n\n\nIn applying the tariffs, Washington relied on a rarely-used WTO national security exemption, which permits governments to take “any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.” The Trump administration has already blocked the process once, and since the rules don’t allow further preventative actions, the WTO will likely create a dispute settlement panel, which would consist of three experts. Any decision would likely be rendered in 2019 or 2020.\n\n\n\n3.4.7 Trump and his trade war with China\nDonald J. Trump said in his 2016 presidential campaign, see time.com:\n\n“We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements and cheat in every way imaginable, and our politicians did nothing about it. Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result. I have visited cities and towns across this country where one-third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years. Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export. We can’t continue to do that. This is not some natural disaster, it’s a political and politician-made disaster. Very simple. And it can be corrected and we can correct it fast when we have people with the right thinking. Right up here. […] To understand why trade reform creates jobs, and it creates a lot of them, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper. Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product. From 1947 to 2001, a span of over five decades, our inflation-adjusted Gross Domestic Product grew at a rate of 3.5 percent. However, since 2002, the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports, the GDP growth rate has been cut in half. [] A Trump administration will change our failed trade policies, and I mean quickly.”\n\nI don’t want to go into details about the trade disputes of China and USA. A concise and continually revised overview is offered by Wikipedia.\nThe following charts show the trade surplus/deficit (exports minus imports) for the USA, China, Russia, and Germany. The data were downloaded on 15th of June 2022 from tradingeconomics.com.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.19: Balance of trade of the U.S. over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.19 indicates that Trump was not successful in reducing the trade deficit. Overall, it seems to be the case that trade wars are not that easy to win as he claimed. It is rather difficult to impact the trade deficit within some years. Moreover, it is almost impossible to create more jobs that are lost and boost the economy with starting trade disputes.\nFor those who are interested: Here is a well researched article about that topic by Ryan Hass and Abraham Denmark, entitled More pain than gain: How the US-China trade war hurt America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.4 Balance of payments across countries\nFigure 3.20 shows the balance of trade over time for China, Russia, and Germany.

I would say the WTO was the single worst trade deal ever made.\nAnd if they don’t shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO. We rarely won a lawsuit except for the last year. You know, in the last year, we’re starting to win a lot. You know why? Because they know if we don’t, I’m out of there. I’ll take them out.”\n\nDiscuss the legal constitution of the WTO and whether Donald Trump is right when he claims that other countries treat the United States unfair. Thereto, I recommend the article Why Trump’s wrong about WTO treating US unfairly from Kucik (2018).\n\nWTO members are not permitted to increase import tariffs without justification. An exception to this rule, however, is given when the national security of a nation is at risk. On this basis (which has been challenged within the WTO by several nations, including Canada), U.S. President Trump has issued executive orders imposing import tariffs on steel and aluminum imports for a set of different countries. Discuss whether this behavior can be considered as fair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s claims are difficult to assess because it is unclear what he means by fairness or how to define fairness in trade relations in general.\nWhen referencing WTO rules, U.S. policy is far from a model of fairness to others, as too many countries have sued the U.S. for its discriminatory policies. Although he is wrong in his claim that the U.S. has “rarely won a lawsuit, with the exception of last year” (the U.S. win rate is similar to the average win rate), the U.S. is the country that has sued other members more often than any other country.\nImposing and increasing tariffs based on the exception rule could irreparably damage the WTO’s authority to adjudicate trade disputes. This is because U.S. trade representatives contend that the WTO does not have the authority to mediate national security issues and should simply issue a ruling that the matter is not within the WTO’s jurisdiction. This argument puts a gun to the WTO’s head. If the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body follows this line of reasoning, any country could easily impose tariffs in the future, citing national security, without the WTO being able to judge whether or not the issue is truly one of national security. This reminds (me) of the Mexican standoff, that is, a confrontation between three or more parties in which there is no strategy that allows one party to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKucik, J. (2018).

Do you comprehend their points in light of everything you’ve learned in the course so far? If anything is unclear, please specify what you find confusing.\nDerviş & Conroy (2018): “What’s behind Trump’s trade war?”\n\n“Donald Trump’s justifications for his aggressive trade policy – that it will reduce the US current-account deficit and save vulnerable American industries – do not withstand scrutiny. At the heart of Trump’s trade war is an impulse to free American power from the supposed shackles of multilateralism.\nWAHINGTON, DC – Since World War II’s end, trade has grown 50 percent faster than global GDP, owing largely to successive rounds of liberalization under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (previously the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT). But now, U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest dose of import tariffs could push the world into a full-blown trade war, undoing much of that progress.\nProponents of free trade have always celebrated the growth of international commerce because they regard it as a sign that countries are capitalizing on their comparative advantages through specialization, which implies increased efficiency overall. By contrast, critics of free trade worry that it might lock poor countries into producing goods that offer little room for productivity growth, and point out that even if there are aggregate gains from globalization, there are also clear losers.\nIn fact, few would disagree that a static comparative advantage theory is a poor guide for development policy. A more dynamic framework is needed to determine whether trade also brings knowledge and learning to new markets. If it does, then it can be an engine of future economic growth and social progress.\nOverall, there is overwhelming evidence that trade has indeed enriched developing countries where supportive policies have been in place. Over time, developing countries have learned to complement trade policies with higher investment in infrastructure and education. But with the world trading system now under assault by the United States, the question for developing countries is how to respond.\nTo justify his tariffs, Trump points to America’s bilateral (or multilateral) trade deficits with its trading partners. But while tariffs can change the composition of trade flows, they will have little bearing on the current-account balance, which is determined by national savings and investment. If savings fall short of investment—as they do in the U.S.—the current account will necessarily be in deficit.\nTo be sure, tariffs can have an incidental effect on the current-account balance. As a tax on domestic consumers and a subsidy for certain domestic producers, tariffs reduce consumers’ disposable income and augment capital income. To the extent that more capital income is saved relative to labor income, tariffs will increase the economy’s overall savings rate. Nevertheless, this effect on the savings-investment balance is both weak and indirect.\nAt the micro level, Trump might argue that tariffs are necessary to protect particular sectors. But many of the goods imported into the U.S. actually contain intermediate inputs that were originally produced domestically (this is even more the case for China). So, to determine whether tariffs are actually protecting the value added-wages and profits in a particular U.S. sector, one must also account for the U.S. value added within imports that are now facing levies. Assuming that Trump’s advisers have explained these complications to him, one wonders what his real rationale is.\nWhile Trump’s desire to prop up politically important industries and reduce the U.S. current-account deficit has certainly played a role in his trade policy, it is clear that his main target is the WTO and the multilateralism that it represents. Trump seems to think that multilateralism dilutes American power, given that the U.S. can always use its economic and geopolitical clout to win a bilateral dispute. What he doesn’t realize is that even the world’s most powerful country still needs impartial global rules and disinterested institutions to oversee them.\nOver the past 70-odd years, the GATT/WTO system has developed into a multilateral arrangement whereby the same rules apply to all countries alike. That is not to say that bigger and richer countries lack advantages over smaller and poorer countries. Countries like the U.S. can allocate more staff and specialists to support their own producers in complicated trade negotiations, while also pursuing parallel (back-channel) diplomacy. Legally, however, the WTO is a grouping of equals. The “most favored nation” provision means that an advantage extended to one country’s producers must be extended to all.\nPerhaps most important, the WTO has a dispute-settlement mechanism (DSM) that provides for the timely resolution of disagreements between member states. Though the U.S. has won most of the cases that it has brought before the WTO’s arbitration panel, it has also lost some. With the ability to hand down binding judgments, the DSM is a unique feature of the WTO system. No other multilateral body has such a mechanism.\nThere are many ways that the multilateral system could be improved, of course. The WTO, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund should be devising new approaches to address the growing influence of Big Tech; and competition policy needs to be brought into the twenty-first century. It might also be appropriate for the WTO to adopt a form of weighted voting, similar to the procedure used by the IMF and World Bank.\nAs for the criticism that globalization produces both winners and losers, this is not an argument against trade; it is an argument for policies to compensate those who have been left behind. On that basis, those who have rightly criticized the WTO in the past should join forces with its supporters. Both sides have an interest in defending this key institution of global governance from the xenophobic unilateralism embodied by Trump’s policies.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerviş, K., & Conroy, C. (2018).

    "text": "3.6 Tariffs in small open economies\nFigure 3.23 can teach us a lot about the impact of a tariff \\(t\\) on trade and welfare. A tariff raises the domestic price of imported goods. If we assume that the imposition or change of a country’s tariff has no effect on the world price, we consider what is called a small open economy, which is so small that the country’s consumption and production decisions do not affect the world price. In other words, the country takes the world price for granted because its import demand does not change the world price.\nIn autarky, the economy represented in Figure 3.23 would consume 5 units at price \\(P^A\\), and total welfare would be represented by areas \\(a+b_2+b_1\\). Under free trade without tariffs, the country imports 8 units and consumes 9 units at the price of \\(P^W\\). The consumer surplus corresponds to areas \\(a+b_2+d_1+c+d_2\\) and the producer surplus corresponds to area \\(b_1\\). After the introduction of tariff \\(t\\), the consumer surplus is equal to area \\(a\\) and the producer surplus is equal to area \\(b_1+b_2\\). Thus, consumer surplus has decreased while producer surplus has increased. The area \\(c\\) is equal to the government’s revenue. It represents the portion of the consumer welfare loss that is transferred to the government. Overall, welfare has decreased. The welfare loss is equal to the areas of the two triangles \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\). These triangles represent what is called the deadweight loss due to the tariff.\nSpecifically, triangle \\(d_1\\) represents the reduction in imports that is replaced by domestic production, and triangle \\(d_2\\) represents the loss in consumption due to a reduction in imports and a reduction in domestic consumption.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.23: Tariff in a small open economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implications of a tariff in a small economy\n\n\n\nWhile a tariff protects domestic producers and increases their surplus, it reduces the surplus of consumers and leads to a deadweight loss of revenue.

    "text": "3.7 Quotas in small open economies\nA trade restriction that sets a physical limit on the quantity of a good to be imported is called an import quota. It gives government officials more power and control than a tariff because they can strictly limit the quantity of goods traded and have the administrative authority to grant (or sell) import licenses to certain foreign exporters.\nFigure 3.24 shows the impact of an import quota that allows an import quantity of 4 units. In this scenario, 7 units are consumed, four of which are imported. The price at which all seven units are consumed is \\(P*\\). This is somewhat surprising because the world price \\(P^W\\) is less than \\(P^*\\).

    "text": "3.8 Tariffs in large open economies\nSo far, we have assumed that the country of interest is small and takes the world market price as given. However, large countries’ demand for imported goods can have an impact on world prices. If this is the case, we can show that a tariff can actually improve a country’s welfare. Figure 3.25 illustrates the effects of a tariff on welfare, prices, and trade. In particular, we show the impact of a small tariff of 6 euros per bicycle.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.25: The effect of a tariff in a large country\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder free trade, the market for bicycle imports is cleared at a price of €300 and the country imports one million bicycles.\nNow, if a tariff of 6€ per bicycle is imposed, the tariff drives a wedge between the price foreign exporters receive and the price domestic buyers of imports pay. That is, it becomes more expensive for domestic buyers to purchase imported bicycles. This, in turn, leads to an immediate drop in domestic demand for bicycles and pushes the world market price for bicycles to €297 Given the new world market price for bicycles, the domestic price for imported bicycles is €303 (297+6).\nThe consumer surplus is now represented by the blue area and the producer surplus by the yellow area. The green area represents the tariff revenue collected by the government. The two gray triangles, in turn, show the tariff-related deadweight losses. Compared to the free trade scenario, the country gains rectangle \\(c_2\\). If the revenue in this area is greater than the deadweight loss, the country has improved its overall welfare by imposing a tariff.\nLet us calculate whether this is the case here:\n\nArea \\(c_2\\): \\[\n(1.58 \\text{ million bikes} - 0.62 \\text{ million bikes})\\cdot (\\text{€} 300-\\text{€} 297)=\\text{€} 2.88 \\text{ million}\n\\]\nDeadweight loss: \\[\\begin{align}\n  \\underbrace{\\frac{(0.62 \\text{ mio b.}-0.6 \\text{ mio b.})\\cdot (\\text{€} 303 - \\text{€} 300)}{2}}_{\\text{left triangle}} + \\\\\n  \\underbrace{\\frac{(1.6 \\text{ mio b.}-1.58 \\text{ mio b.})\\cdot (\\text{€} 303 - \\text{€} 300)}{2}}_{\\text{right triangle}}\\\\\n  =\\text{€}  0.06 \\text{ million}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIndeed, the net gain is €2.82 million.

    "section": "3.9 Other nontariff trade barriers",
    "text": "3.9 Other nontariff trade barriers\nIn addition to tariffs, there are a variety of other trade barriers. These so-called non-tariff barriers (NTBs) include quotas, export subsidies, domestic production subsidies, government buy-at-home policies, and product standards. Here is a more complete list:\n\nImport quotas\nVoluntary export restraints\nAntidumping laws\nExchange-rate controls\nCountervailing duties\nGovernment subsidies\nLicensing, labeling and packaging restrictions\nQuality controls and technical standards\nDomestic-content laws\nPolitical rhetoric\nEmbargoes and sanctions\nMost/least-favored nation status\n\nFor example, product standards are much more important than you might think. For example, no car from the United States can be sold in the European Union without modifications because our safety standards are different. Another example is the CE marking (see below). Harmonization of product standards is usually an important issue in trade agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCE Marking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.26: The CE marking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CE marking shown in Figure 3.26 is one example for a non tariff trade barrier. It is not an abbreviation for China Export, as many believe. While CE is sometimes indicated as an abbreviation of Conformite Europeenne (French for European Conformity), it is not defined as such in the relevant legislation. The mark indicates that the product may be sold freely in any part of the European Economic Area, irrespective of its country of origin. The CE marking is a declaration by the manufacturer (not by some authority!) that the product complies with EU standards for health, safety and environmental protection for products sold within the European Economic Area (EEA). Thus, it is not a quality indicator or a certification mark and may also be found on products sold outside the EEA. You may also know the _FCC Declaration of Conformity} which is used for selling certain electronic devices in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.7 Tariff (Solution 3.2)\nReferring to Figure 3.27, the government of a large country needs your help to decide whether the introduction of a tariff of $100 per metric ton of on steel is a good idea, or not. At the current world market price of \\(p^W=\\) 600$, the country imports 14 millions metric tons of steel. The government expects that a tariff of $100 per ton of steel would decrease the world market price of steel for $1.\n\nCalculate how much the overall welfare gain (or loss) of the country would be in case the government decides to introduce a tariff of $ 100 per ton of steel. Assume thereby that the supply curve is given by \\[\nP^s=400+\\frac{1}{2}Q^s\n\\] and the demand curve is given by \\[\nP^d=1500-\\frac{1}{2}Q^d.\n\\] These curves are also shown in the figure below.\nWhat would be the tariff so high that it makes an import of steel prohibitively expensive.\nWhat would be the world market price so low that it makes any domestic production unprofitable.\nWhat would be the world market price so high that the country exports steel.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.27: Exercise: Tariff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 3.2. Tariff (Exercise 3.7)\n\nBy analogy with Figure 3.25, here we should compare the two gray triangles with area \\(c_2\\).\n\nThe price per metric ton of steel from foreign suppliers will be $699 because government will charge $100 on each ton of steel which is now worth $599 on world markets. As $699 is still below the autarky price of $950, domestic suppliers will set prices to be equal to $699. Thus,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n            699&=400+\\frac{1}{2}Q^s \\Leftrightarrow Q^s=598\\\\\n            699&=1500-\\frac{1}{2}Q^d \\Leftrightarrow Q^d=1602\\\\\n            1602-598 &=1004\n\\end{align*}\\] That means, at a price of $699 domestic supply is 598 and domestic demand is 1602 tons of steel. 1004 tons will be imported.\nTo calculate the welfare loss (the two triangles), we can calculate the left triangle only and double it (please note that this is only possible if both triangles really have the same size which is only the case if both supply and demand curves have the same slope in absolute terms!): \\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\overbrace{\\left(\\underbrace{(598-400)}_{\\text{loss in quantity}}\\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2}}_{\\text{to get the triangle}}\\cdot \\underbrace{(699-600)}_{\\text{increase in price}}\\right)}^{\\text{left triangle}}\n\\cdot \\overbrace{2}^{\\text{right triangle is of same size}}\\\\\n&=9801\\cdot 2\\\\\n&=19602\n\\end{align*}\\] The welfare gain (the new square that is due to the change in world market price, a.k.a. \\(c_2\\)) is \\[\n1004 \\text{tons} \\cdot  1\n\\left[\n\\frac{\\text{\\$}}{\\text{tons}}\n\\right] = 1004 \\text{\\$}.\n\\] Thus, overall welfare gain is \\[\n1004-19602=-18598.\n\\] That means, the welfare loss exceeds the welfare gain by $ 18598.\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n            400+\\frac{1}{2}Q&=1500-\\frac{1}{2}Q\\\\\n            \\Leftrightarrow Q&=1100\\\\\n            P^s&=400+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1100\\\\\n            P^s&=950\n\\end{align*}\\] At a price above $950, no steel would be imported. Thus, a tariff must be so high that the price of foreign steel within the country exceeds $950, that is, \\(P^W+t&gt;950\\). Assuming that the world market price would have a lower bound of $599, that is, any tariff above $100 would not decrease the world market price any further, a tariff of $351 (950-599=351) would make imported steel prohibitively expensive.\n\nBelow a price of $400 any domestic production would be unprofitable because the supply curve tells us that no domestic producer would be able to supply anything at and below the price of $400. To proof that just set \\(Q^s=0\\) in the function of the supply curve and you get \\(P^s=400\\).\nAt a world market price above $950, it would be profitable to export steel because domestic supply exceeds domestic demand and the world market price is higher than the production costs.",

    "text": "A.1 Production functions\nA firm or a company is a productive unit. In particular, it is an organization that produces goods and services. In short, it can be called output. To do so, it uses inputs called factors of production, that is, labor, capital, land, skills, etc. The relationship between the inputs and the output is the production function. The goal of the firm is to achieve whatever goal its owner(s) decide to achieve through the firm. Usually, it is (and in Germany for example it has to be the case by law) to generate profits, that is, total revenue minus total cost for the level of production.\nA production function (PF) is a mathematical representation of the process that transforms inputs into output.\nThe returns to scale describes the increase in output when a firm multiples all of its inputs by some factor. Let \\(\\lambda&gt;1,\\) then, with two factors \\(\\mathrm{K}\\) and \\(L\\), we can define that for \\[\nf(c K, c L)= c^\\lambda f(K, L),\n\\]\nThe marginal product is the change in the total output when the input varies of one infinitesimal small unit. Graphically, the marginal product is the slope of the total product function at any point. The slope of the total product function, that is, the marginal product, is generally not constant. The marginal product to an input is assumed to decrease beyond some level of input. This is called the law of diminishing marginal returns. In particular, we can distinguish:",

    "text": "A.2 Production possibility frontier curve\n\n\n\nFigure A.1: The production possibility frontier curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe production possibilities frontier (PPF) curve shown in Figure A.1 provides a graphical representation of all possible production options for two products when all available resources and factors of production are fully and efficiently utilized within a given time period. The PPF serves as a boundary between combinations of goods and services that can be produced and those that cannot.\nThe PPF is an invaluable tool for illustrating the effects of scarcity as it provides insights into production efficiency, opportunity costs and the trade-offs between different choices. In general, the PPF exhibits concavity, as not all factors of production can be used equally productively in all activities.\nEconomic growth refers to the continuous expansion of production possibilities. An economy experiences growth through technological advances, improvements in the quality of labor or an increase in the factors of production (labor, capital). When the resources of an economy increase, the production possibilities also expand, shifting the PPF outwards. It is worth noting that PPF can be used to explain production in an economy or company.\nProduction efficiency occurs when it is impossible to produce more of one good or service without producing less of another. If production takes place directly on the PPF, this means efficiency. If, on the other hand, production takes place within the PPF (yellow shaded area of Figure A.1), it is possible to produce more goods without sacrificing existing goods, which indicates inefficiency. If production is on the PPF, there is a trade-off, as obtaining more of one good requires sacrificing a certain amount of another good. This trade-off is associated with costs called opportunity costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise A.1 Understanding production (Solution A.1)\n\nFigure A.2 shows a PPF and five conceivable production points, \\(C_i\\), where \\(i\\in \\{1,\\dots,5\\}\\). Explain the figure using the following terms: _attainable point; available resources, unattainable, inefficient, efficient point.\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.2: Production and different consumption points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would happen to the PPF if the technology available in a country and needed for the production process became better?\nWhat would happen to the PPF if the resources available in a country and needed in the production process of both goods shrank?\nWhat would happen to the PPF if the resources (technology) available in a country that are needed in the production process…\n\n…for both goods increased (improved)?\n…for good A shrank (got worse)?\n…for good B increased (improved)?\n\nDoes the shape of the PPF tell us anything about economies of scale in the production process?\nFigure A.3 shows an extreme PPF. How can such a PPF be explained?\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.3: Extreme production possibility frontier curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution A.1. Understanding production (Exercise A.1)\n\nAny point that lies either on the production possibilities curve or to the left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Production points that lie in the yellow shaded area are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. These points represent an inefficient production, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.\nThe PPF would shift outwards.\nThe PPF would shift inwards.\nThe PPF would shift…\n\n…outwards for both goods.\n…inwards for good A, see Figure A.4.\n…outwards for good B.\n\nWith economies of scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the opportunity cost of one good falling as more of it is produced. A straight-line (linear) PPF reflects a situation where resources are not specialized and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. With constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if there was only one factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve.\nHere is one example: Suppose a country that is endowed with two factors of production and that one factor can only be used for producing good A and the other factor can only be used to produce good B.\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.4: Shrinking production possibilities in good A",

These curves illustrate the various bundles of goods where consumers are equally satisfied. That means all points on an indifference curve represent the same level of utility. The shape of the indifference curve is determined by the underlying utility function, which captures the preferences of consumers for consuming different combinations of the two goods.\nThe slope of an indifference curve indicates the rate at which the two goods can be substituted while maintaining the same level of utility for the consumer. Technically, the slope represents the marginal rate of substitution, which is equal to the absolute value of the slope. It measures the maximum quantity of one good that a consumer is willing to give up in order to obtain an additional unit of the other good.\nIt is assumed that consumers aim to attain the highest possible indifference curve because a higher curve, located further to the right on a coordinate system, represents a higher level of utility. In Figure A.6, for example, \\((IC_1)\\) represents a lower level of utility than \\((IC_2)\\).\n\n\n\nFigure A.6: Indifference curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the concept of indifference curves, an isoquant shows the combinations of factors of production that result in the same quantity of output.\n\n\n\nFigure A.7: Perfect complements or substitutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise A.2 Isoquants\n\nWhich of the two plots of Figure A.7 show isoquants when factors of production are perfect complements and perfect substitutes, respectively?\nDiscuss the features of a Cobb-Douglas PF with respect to returns to scale and marginal product of production for both inputs.

    "text": "A.4 Budget constraint\nIn microeconomics, the concept of a budget constraint plays a vital role in understanding consumer decision-making and helps to analyze consumer choices and trade-offs. The budget constraint represents the limitations faced by consumers in allocating their limited income across different goods and services. The budget constraint indicates that the total expenditure on goods and services, calculated by multiplying the prices of each item by its corresponding quantity, must be less than or equal to the consumer’s income. Mathematically, the budget constraint can be expressed as: \\[\nP_1 \\cdot Q_1 + P_2 \\cdot Q_2 + \\ldots + P_n \\cdot Q_n \\leq I\n\\] where (\\(P_n\\)) represent the prices of goods, (\\(Q_n\\)) denote the quantities of goods (\\(n\\)) consumed. (\\(I\\)) denotes the consumer’s income or their budget.\nConsumers strive to maximize their utility by selecting the optimal combination of goods and services within the constraints imposed by their limited income. This involves making decisions about how much of each good to consume while staying within the budgetary limits. The graphical representation of the ideal consumption point is depicted in Figure Figure A.8.\nBy studying the budget constraint, economists can gain insights into consumer behavior, price changes, and the impact of income fluctuations on consumption patterns.\n\n\n\nFigure A.8: Optimal consumption choice",
