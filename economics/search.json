I completed postgraduate studies at the Interdisciplinary Graduate Center of Excellence at the Institute for Labor Law and Industrial Relations in the European Union (IAAEU) in Trier. Prior to my current position, I worked as a research assistant to Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Joachim Möller at the University of Regensburg, a post-doc at the Leibniz Institute for East and Southeast European Studies (IOS) in Regensburg, and a freelancer at Charles University in Prague.\nThroughout my career, I have also worked as a lecturer at various institutions, including the TU Munich, the University of Regensburg, Saarland University, and the Universities of Applied Sciences in Frankfurt and Augsburg. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to teach abroad for the University of Cordoba in Spain, the University of Perugia in Italy, and the Petra Christian University in Surabaya, Indonesia.

    "section": "Teaching principles",
    "text": "Teaching principles\nI believe in the Keep It Simple and Straightforward principle (KISS), which emphasizes simplicity and clarity in all aspects of learning and teaching. This, however, does not imply that the content of the book easy to understand. Success still requires logical thinking and a strong work ethic. Those who struggle with this may find it difficult to pass my courses.\nIn the following sections, I will introduce various mathematical economic models and concepts that provide a structured framework for understanding economics. Familiarity with these concepts is necessary for understanding current literature and analyzing complex scenarios in international trade.\nEconomic models are based on transparent assumptions and usually consist of a set of equations that explain theories of economic behavior. A robust model should provide valuable insights into the behavior of rational actors and the workings of the economy.\nUnfortunately, students sometimes feel overwhelmed by these models because of their reliance on math and rigorous logical reasoning. There is often a perception that there are simpler ways to convey these arguments. While this may occasionally be true, I firmly believe that the formal approach to introducing international economics is most beneficial in the long run. Allow me to back up this belief:\n\nThe narrative method, characterized by storytelling and bullet points, is a quick way to convey information on a variety of topics. However, it also has its drawbacks: students can easily get caught up in intuitive anecdotes without developing critical thinking or recognizing the underlying driving forces. As a result, they memorize information only for exams and forget it shortly thereafter.\nUnlike anecdotes, formal models are not inherently true; however, they can provide deeper insights into a topic than narratives. In Appendix A — From anecdote to insight, I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of anecdotes from an epistemological perspective in greater detail.\nCompared to anecdotes, formal models usually offer more flexibility. Once students understand the underlying logic of a model and can interpret and evaluate its implications, they can apply their understanding to different circumstances or topics. In contrast, anecdotes often provide a narrow perspective on a problem, making it difficult to draw general conclusions.\nA mathematical economic model functions much like a proof of an argument in that it accurately describes the assumptions under which the argument holds. In contrast, narratives often obscure the underlying assumptions and premises of an argument.\nFormal argumentation is the norm in economic research. Familiarity with basic concepts therefore enables students to understand the current literature, conduct research and solve problems in their professional lives.\nUnderstanding an economic model means grasping the underlying relationships, which promotes retention. In essence, formal models promote students’ independent thinking and reasoning rather than mere repetition of the teacher’s words.",

Feynman’s Los Alamos ID badge\n\n\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Richard_Feynman_Los_Alamos_ID_badge.jpg\n\n\n\nRichard P. Feynman (1918-1988) was a team leader at the Manhatten Project (see Figure 2) and won the Nobel Prize in 1965 in physics. He once said:\n\n“I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way – by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!” (Feynman, 1985)\n\nFeynman, R. P. (1985). Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a curious character. W.W. Norton.\n\nOf course, the key to learning is understanding. However, I believe that there is no understanding without practice, that is, solving problems and exercises by yourself with a pencil and a blank sheet of paper without knowing the solution in advance. Thus, I recommend the following:\n\nAttend lectures and and take the opportunity to ask questions and actively participate in class.\nStudy the lecture notes and work on the exercises.\nReview the material regularly each week. Learning in small increments is more effective than last-minute cramming.\nTest yourself with past exams that you find in the appendix.\nIf you have the opportunity to form a study group, make use of it. It is great to help each other, and it is very motivating to see that everyone has problems sometimes.\nIf you have difficulties with some exercises and the solutions shown do not solve your problem, ask a classmate or contact me.\n\nI am convinced that following my recommendations is the best method for students to\n\nmaximize leisure time and minimize the time needed to prepare for the exam, respectively,\ngetting long-term benefits out of the course,\nimprove grades, and\nhave more fun during lecture hours.",

    "text": "About the structure of these notes\nI present international economics divided into three major branches:\nMonetary international economics: This chapter explicitly considers the meaning of the international financial transaction.\nInternational trade: This chapter is concerned with the determination of relative prices and real incomes in international trade abstracting from the intervention of money. That means trade is considered as an exchange of goods with no financial transactions involved. Of course, this assumption is unrealistic. However, it helps to understand the driving forces of real-world problems.\nTrade policy: This chapter is about how international economics is taken into action to build the world we live in.\nMoreover, in an appendix I offer solutions to the exercises, some microeconomic and mathematical preliminaries, and some past exams.",

    "text": "Literature\nMy lecture notes are not intended to compete with comprehensive textbooks. They are concise and cannot fully explain various economic phenomena. Therefore, I recommend reading a textbook that provides a basic explanation of the concepts I use. This is especially true if you are looking for a deeper understanding or if you are not familiar with the economic principles discussed. Summarized below and spread across the chapters, you find sources that may serve you well.\nEconomic textbooks: Any major economics textbook can be used to complement this lecture. I personally recommend Mankiw (2024), Blanchard & Johnson (2013), and the open source textbook Shapiro et al. (2022) but you can also use Parkin (2012), Case et al. (2019), and Krugman & Wells (2018). While it is always nice to have a more recent textbook, basically older copies are just as fine (and much cheaper). Also, there are good books that are freely available online such as Shapiro et al. (2022), Anon (2020), Goodwin (2012), and Klein & Bauman (2010).\n\nMankiw, N. G. (2024).
