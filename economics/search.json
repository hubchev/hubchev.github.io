    "text": "Teaching principles\nI believe in the Keep It Simple and Straightforward principle (KISS), which emphasizes simplicity and clarity in all aspects of learning and teaching. This, however, does not imply that the content of the book easy to understand. Success still requires logical thinking and a strong work ethic. Those who struggle with this may find it difficult to pass my courses.\nIn the following sections, I will introduce various mathematical economic models and concepts that provide a structured framework for understanding economics. Familiarity with these concepts is necessary for understanding current literature and analyzing complex scenarios in international trade.\nEconomic models are based on transparent assumptions and usually consist of a set of equations that explain theories of economic behavior. A robust model should provide valuable insights into the behavior of rational actors and the workings of the economy.\nUnfortunately, students sometimes feel overwhelmed by these models because of their reliance on math and rigorous logical reasoning. There is often a perception that there are simpler ways to convey these arguments. While this may occasionally be true, I firmly believe that the formal approach to introducing international economics is most beneficial in the long run. Allow me to back up this belief:\n\nThe narrative method, characterized by storytelling and bullet points, is a quick way to convey information on a variety of topics. However, it also has its drawbacks: students can easily get caught up in intuitive anecdotes without developing critical thinking or recognizing the underlying driving forces. As a result, they memorize information only for exams and forget it shortly thereafter.\nUnlike anecdotes, formal models are not inherently true; however, they can provide deeper insights into a topic than narratives. In ?sec-anecdote, I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of anecdotes from an epistemological perspective in greater detail.\nCompared to anecdotes, formal models usually offer more flexibility. Once students understand the underlying logic of a model and can interpret and evaluate its implications, they can apply their understanding to different circumstances or topics. In contrast, anecdotes often provide a narrow perspective on a problem, making it difficult to draw general conclusions.\nA mathematical economic model functions much like a proof of an argument in that it accurately describes the assumptions under which the argument holds. In contrast, narratives often obscure the underlying assumptions and premises of an argument.\nFormal argumentation is the norm in economic research. Familiarity with basic concepts therefore enables students to understand the current literature, conduct research and solve problems in their professional lives.\nUnderstanding an economic model means grasping the underlying relationships, which promotes retention. In essence, formal models promote students’ independent thinking and reasoning rather than mere repetition of the teacher’s words.",

Feynman’s Los Alamos ID badge\n\n\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Richard_Feynman_Los_Alamos_ID_badge.jpg\n\n\n\nRichard P. Feynman (1918-1988) was a team leader at the Manhattan Project (see Figure 4.1) and won the Nobel Prize in 1965 in physics. He once said:\n\n“I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way – by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!” (Feynman, 1985)\n\nFeynman, R. P. (1985). Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a curious character. W.W. Norton.\n\nOf course, the key to learning is understanding. However, I believe that there is no understanding without practice, that is, solving problems and exercises by yourself with a pencil and a blank sheet of paper without knowing the solution in advance. Thus, I recommend the following:\n\nAttend lectures and and take the opportunity to ask questions and actively participate in class.\nStudy the lecture notes and work on the exercises.\nReview the material regularly each week. Learning in small increments is more effective than last-minute cramming.\nTest yourself with past exams that you find in the appendix.\nIf you have the opportunity to form a study group, make use of it. It is great to help each other, and it is very motivating to see that everyone has problems sometimes.\nIf you have difficulties with some exercises and the solutions shown do not solve your problem, ask a classmate or contact me.\n\nI am convinced that following my recommendations is the best method for students to\n\nmaximize leisure time and minimize the time needed to prepare for the exam, respectively,\ngetting long-term benefits out of the course,\nimprove grades, and\nhave more fun during lecture hours.",

That means trade is considered as an exchange of goods with no financial transactions involved. Of course, this assumption is unrealistic. However, it helps to understand the driving forces of real-world problems.\nTrade policy: This chapter is about how international economics is taken into action to build the world we live in.\nMoreover, in an appendix I offer solutions to the exercises, some microeconomic and mathematical preliminaries, and some past exams.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Production and productivity\nEconomics is the study of how to maximize welfare, production, consumption of goods and services, and whatever may be considered beneficial for an economy and the people that live therein.\n\nWikipedia (2022): “An economy is an area of the production, distribution, and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services. In general, it is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of scarce resources. Simplified, one can say that an economy is a system for providing livelihoods to people.”\n\nWikipedia. (2022). Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.1 Production and Productivity\nDiscuss the meaning of the terms production and productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Efficiency and effectiveness\nEconomics and successful management revolves around two key concepts: Efficiency and Effectiveness.\nEfficiency refers to the ability to achieve an intended result while minimizing waste in terms of time, effort, and resources. It emphasizes performing tasks in the most optimal manner, such as achieving results quickly or at the lowest cost. However, it’s important to note that efficiency can sometimes be applied to the wrong activities, meaning that while the task may be done optimally, the outcome may not be the desired one.\nPlease keep in mind that efficiency is not an indicator of doing the right things. For example, if you are a business that provides a product that nobody wants to buy anymore, you can produce this product with the highest efficiency possible, but you will ultimately fail.\nEffectiveness, on the other hand, is the capacity to produce better results that deliver greater value or achieve more favorable outcomes. It focuses on ensuring that the right tasks are carried out, completing activities successfully, and ultimately reaching one’s goals.\nManagers and individuals with goals should choose actions that are effective—meaning those actions allow them to achieve their intended objectives—and they should strive to execute these actions efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.2 Wisdom of the Dakota Indians\nA well-known piece of wisdom from the Dakota Indians states: “If you realize that you are riding a dead horse, get off!”\nDiscuss what could that mean in a management context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen managers are not doing the right thing they sometimes refuse to accept that they have the wrong business idea or the wrong strategy or product. Instead, they often tend to pursue the chosen strategy trying to do things more efficiency. To stay in the metapher:\n\nThey procure a stronger whip.\nThey change the rider.\nThey argue, “That’s how we’ve always ridden this horse!”\nThey form a working group to analyze the dead horse.\nThey visit other places to see how they handle dead horses there.\nThey raise the quality standards for riding dead horses.\nThey create a task force to revive the dead horse.\nThey schedule a training session to learn how to ride better.\nThey make comparisons between different dead horses.\nThey change the criteria that determine whether a horse is dead.\nThey hire external experts to ride the dead horse.\nThey yoke several dead horses together to make them faster.\nThey assert, “No horse can be so dead that it can’t be beaten!”\nThey allocate additional resources to improve the horse’s performance.\nThey commission a study to find out if there are cheaper consultants.\nThey purchase something that claims to teach dead horses to run faster.\nThey declare that our horse is better, faster, and cheaper when dead.\nThey form a quality circle to find a use for dead horses.\nThey revise the performance criteria for dead horses.\nThey establish an independent cost center for dead horses.\nThey have the horses certified as quickly as possible.\nThey freeze the horses and wait for a new technology that will allow them to ride dead horses.\nThey form a prayer group to pray for the horse’s health.\nThey place the horse in someone else’s stable and claim it as theirs.\nThey note that others are also riding dead horses and declare this the norm.\nThey change the requirements for riding and movement and issue a new development mandate.\nThey outsource the horse.\nThey bet that the horse is just pretending to be dead.\nIf you can’t ride a dead horse, it can at least pull a cart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Economic topics\nYou are studying economics at a time of enormous change. Some of these changes are for the better, while others are for the worse. Studying economics will help you to understand the powerful forces that are shaping and changing our world.\nRecent topics in economics:\n\nCOVID\nProtectionism/trade war\nBrexit\nEuro crisis\nMonetary policy\nRefugees\nGermany’s trade surplus\nGreece’s debt crisis\nReal estate crisis\nGlobal financial crisis in 2009\nEconomics of the Corona Crisis\nOil price fluctuations\nU.S. Dollar strength\nEconomics of climate change\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Definitions\n\nAll economic questions arise because we want more than we can get.\nOur inability to satisfy all our wants is called scarcity.\nBecause we face scarcity, we must make choices.\nThe choices we make depend on the incentives we face. An incentive is a reward that encourages or a penalty that discourages an action.\n\nEconomics is a social science, and like all social sciences, many of the terms used in it are poorly defined. For example, the term economy can be understood differently, as the following quotes from Figure 1.1 to Figure 1.4 demonstrate:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946)\n\n\n\n\nKeynes (1921): The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessors to draw correct conclusions.\n\nKeynes, J. M. (1921). Money. In D. H. Robertson, Money (Cambridge Economic Handbooks). Cambridge Economic Handbooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Alfred Marshall (1842-1924)\n\n\n\n\nMarshall (2009): “Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life; it examines that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of the material requisites of well-being.”\n\nMarshall, A. (2009). Principles of economics: Unabridged eighth edition. Cosimo, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: James Duesenberry (1918-2009)\n\n\n\n\nDuesenberry (1960): “Economics is all about how people make choices. Sociology is about why there isn’t any choice to be made.”\n\nDuesenberry, J. (1960). Comment on ’an economic analysis of fertility’. In Demographic and economic change in developed countries (National Bureau Committee for Economic Research, pp. 231–234).

C. (2006). Economics (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill Irvin.\n\n\nParkin (2012): “Economics is the social science that studies the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and entire societies make as they cope with scarcity and the incentives that influence and reconcile those choices.”\n\n\nGwartney et al. (2006): “[E]conomics is the study of human behavior, with a particular focus on human decision making.”\n\nGwartney, J. D., Stroup, R. L., Sobel, R. S., & MacPherson, D. A. (2006). Microeconomics: Private and public choice. Mason.\n\n\nBackhouse & Medema (2009): “[E]conomics is apparently the study of the economy, the study of the coordination process, the study of the effects of scarcity, the science of choice, and the study of human behavior.”\n\n\nGreenlaw & Shapiro (2022): “Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.\n\nGreenlaw, S. A., & Shapiro, D. (2022). Principles of economics (2nd ed.). OpenStax.\n\n\nBackhouse & Medema (2009): “Perhaps the definition of economics is best viewed as a tool for the first day of principles classes but otherwise of little concern to practicing economists.”\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Jacob Viner (1892-1970)\n\n\n\n\nJacob Viner: “Economics is what economists do.” (see Backhouse & Medema, 2009)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough many textbook definitions are quite similar in many ways, the lack of agreement on a clear-cut definition of economics is not necessarily problematic, as Backhouse & Medema (2009) states:\n\nBackhouse, R. E., & Medema, S. G. (2009). Retrospectives: On the definition of economics. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 23(1), 221–233.\n\n“[E]conomists are generally guided by pragmatic considerations of what works or by methodological views emanating from various sources, not by formal definitions.”",

    "text": "1.2 Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics\n\nParkin (2012): “Microeconomics is the study of the choices that individuals and businesses make, the way these choices interact in markets, and the influence of governments. […] Macroeconomics is the study of the performance of the national economy and the global economy.’’\n\nParkin, M. (2012). Economics (10th ed.). Addison-Wesley.\n\nMicroeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic perspective focuses on parts of the economy:\n\nIndividuals\nFirms\nIndustries\n\nSome examples of microeconomic questions are:\n\nWhy are people downloading more movies?\nHow would a tax on e-commerce affect eBay?\n\nThe term macro comes from the Greek word makros, meaning large. Thus, it studies groups or the entire economy using aggregate measures related to welfare and standards of living such as:\n\nNational income\nMoney\nTotal (un)employment\nAggregate demand and supply\nTotal savings\nInflation\nGeneral price level\nInternational trade\nBalance of trade,\n…\n\nMacroeconomics employs two key policy approaches to pursue these objectives:\n\nFiscal policy pertains to the regulation of government revenue, expenditures, and debt to generate positive impacts while averting negative effects on income, output, and employment.\nMonetary policy involves controlling money supply and credit to stimulate business activities, foster economic growth, stabilize price levels, attain full employment, and achieve balance of payments equilibrium.\n\nSome examples of macroeconomic questions are:\n\nWhy is the U.S. unemployment rate so high?\nCan the Federal Reserve make our economy expand by cutting interest rates?\n\nWhy separate micro and macroeconomics? Certainly, events occurring at the micro-level can provide insights into phenomena observed at the macro-level, and vice versa. Thus, there is an interdependence of these disciplines. Nevertheless, there remains value in distinguishing them because:\n\nWhat is good at the micro level doesn’t have to be good for the economy as a whole.\nMacroeconomic problems can only be comprehended and solved through macro-level policy actions and programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.3 Read Krugman (1996), which is also available online: Harvard Business Review.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Krugman and Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Source: Krugman (1996) and www.businessinsider.com\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss why Trump may not like Krugman’s expertise on international trade and comment on Krugman (1996)’s quote:\n\n“The next time you hear business people propounding their views about the economy, ask yourself: Have they taken the time to study this subject? Have they read what the experts write? If not, never mind how successful they have been in business. Ignore them, because they probably have no idea what they are talking about.”\n\nDiscuss the following quote from the article What Do Undergrads Need to Know About Trade? by Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman (1993):\n\n“It should be possible to emphasize to students that the level of employment is a macroeconomic issue, depending in the short run on aggregate demand and depending in the long run on the natural rate of unemployment, with microeconomic policies like tariffs having little net effect. Trade policy should be debated in terms of its impact on efficiency, not in terms of phony numbers about jobs created or lost.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKrugman, P. R. (1993).

    "text": "1.3 The scope of economics in five questions\n\nHow do choices end up determining what, where, how, and for whom goods and services get produced?\nWhen do choices made in the pursuit of self-interest also promote the social interest?\n\n\n1.3.1 What?\nAs demonstrated in Figure 1.6, what we produce changes over time.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Clark’s Sector Model for US economy with current events highlighted.\n\n\n\nSource: www.63alfred.com\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 How?\nGoods and services are produced by using productive resources that economists call factors of production:\n\nLand (aka natural resources): These are the gifts of nature that we use to produce goods and services.\nLabor: This is the work time and effort that people devote to production. The quality of labor depends on human capital, which encompasses the knowledge and skill that people obtain from education, on-the-job training, and work experience.\nCapital: Refers to the tools, instruments, machines, buildings, and other constructions employed in the production process.\nEntrepreneurship: This is the human resource that organizes labor, land, and capital. Entrepreneurs come up with new ideas about what and how to produce, make business decisions, and bear the risks that arise from these decisions.\n\nWhat determines the quantities of factors of production used to produce goods and services is a typical economic question.\n\n\n1.3.3 For whom?\nWho gets the goods and services depends on the incomes that people earn. People earn their incomes by selling the services of the factors of production they own:\n\nLand earns rent.\nLabor earns wages.\nCapital earns interest.\nEntrepreneurship earns profit.\n\nWhy is the distribution of income so unequal? Why do women and minorities earn less than white males?\n\n\n1.3.4 Where?\nWe all know the World is not flat: The placement of land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurs in space is important. In particular, Regional Science considers that importance.\n\n“No other discipline can claim such a wide scope of interest and relevance to today’s rapidly changing World.

You like it; however, you want to learn what the acronym TANSTAAFL means before you wear it. Take a moment to discover the message associated with the shirt’s imprint. Do you think your friend’s gift was truly altruistic?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Wikipedia (2025).\n\n\n\n\nWikipedia. (2025). No such thing as a free lunch. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.1 A choice is a tradeoff\nBefore discussing how economists do research, let’s look at six key concepts that define the economic way of thinking:\n\nA choice is a tradeoff.\nPeople make rational decisions by comparing benefits and costs.\nBenefit is what you get out of something.\nCost is what you have to give up to get something.\nMost choices are how-much choices made at the margin.\nChoices respond to incentives.\n\nDue to scarcity, we are forced to make a choice. Whenever we make a decision, we choose from the available alternatives. It can be helpful to think of each choice as a trade-off - an exchange in which we give up one thing to get another.\nThe questions of what, how and for whom become clearer when we consider trade-offs:\n\nWhat? Trade-offs occur when individuals decide how to divide their income, when governments decide how to spend tax revenues, and when companies decide what products to make.\nHow? Trade-offs occur when companies evaluate different production technologies to maximise efficiency.\nFor whom? Trade-offs affect the distribution of purchasing power among citizens. Government redistribution of income from the wealthy to the less fortunate is an example of the great trade-off - the balance between equality and efficiency.\n\nThe production of goods and services—what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is produced—changes over time, leading to improvements in the quality of our economic lives, provided we make wise decisions. The quality of those decisions hinges on the tradeoffs we face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nWe encounter three significant tradeoffs between enjoying current consumption and leisure time versus increasing future production, consumption, and leisure time:\n\nBy saving more today, we can invest in productive capital, such as machinery, which will enhance our production capacity in the upcoming time.\nBy reducing our leisure time, we can focus on education and training, ultimately becoming more productive in the long run.\nIf businesses choose to decrease current production and allocate resources to research and development of new technologies, they can boost future output.\n\nThe decisions we make in this area of conflict have a significant influence on the speed at which our economic conditions improve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.6  \n\nName choices that involve tradeoffs.\nGive some examples for choices without tradeoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Rational choices\nEconomists view the choices that people make as rational. A rational choice is one that compares costs and benefits and achieves the greatest benefit over cost for the person making the choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.7 The businessman and the fisherman\nA classic tale that exists in different versions goes like this:\n\nOne day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish.\nAbout that time, a businessman came walking down the beach, trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family.\n“You aren’t going to catch many fish that way,” said the businessman to the fisherman.\n“You should be working rather than lying on the beach!”\nThe fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled, and replied, “And what will my reward be?”\n“Well, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!” was the businessman’s answer. “And then what will my reward be?” asked the fisherman, still smiling.\nThe businessman replied, “You will make money and you’ll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish!”\n“And then what will my reward be?” asked the fisherman again.\nThe businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman’s questions. “You can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!” he said.\n“And then what will my reward be?” repeated the fisherman.\nThe businessman was getting angry. “Don’t you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!”\nOnce again the fisherman asked, “And then what will my reward be?”\nThe businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, “Don’t you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won’t have a care in the world!”\nThe fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, “And what do you think I’m doing right now?”\n\nSource: This version of the tale stems from theStorytellers.com (2025). \nWho is acting rationally here? The fisherman or the businessman? What are the costs and benefits of both?\n\n\n\n\n\ntheStorytellers.com. (2025). The businessman and the fisherman. https://thestorytellers.com/the-businessman-and-the-fisherman/\n\n\n1.5.3 Benefit: What you gain\nThe utility of an item refers to the gain or pleasure it provides and is determined by preferences, that is, what a person likes or dislikes and the intensity of those feelings. Economists measure utility as the maximum amount a person is willing to give up to obtain something.\n\n\n1.5.4 Cost: What you must give up\nWhen considering a choice as a tradeoff, it is essential to emphasize cost as an opportunity foregone. The opportunity cost of something is the highest-valued alternative that must be sacrificed to get it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtility as a general measure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: The concept of utility\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Bentham (1748–1832)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806–1873)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLéon Walras (1834–1910)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of utility within economics is used to model worth or value, and its usage has evolved significantly over time by many significant people including those shown in Figure 1.8. Initially introduced as a measure of pleasure or happiness within the theory of utilitarianism by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, the concept was later developed and popularized by Léon Walras. In microeconomics, it typically represents the satisfaction or pleasure that consumers derive from consuming a bundle of goods and services.\n\n\n\n\n1.5.5 Choosing at the margin\nChoosing between studying or watching Netflix is rarely an all-or-nothing decision. Instead, you consider how many minutes to allocate to each activity. In making this decision, you compare the benefit of a bit more study time against its cost, effectively making your choice at the margin.\nPeople often make choices at the margin, which means they evaluate the consequences of making incremental changes in the use of their resources.\nThe benefit derived from pursuing a small increase in activity is known as its marginal benefit, while the opportunity cost of that incremental increase is referred to as its marginal cost.\nOur choices respond to incentives. For any activity, if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, people have an incentive to increase that activity. Conversely, if the marginal cost exceeds the marginal benefit, people have an incentive to reduce that activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.8 Marginal analysis\nWatch this video and solve the associated problems.",

It is based on the assumption that a country’s international trade policy serves its citizens’ and companies’ interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.11 Read euronews.com, see Figure 1.15.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.15: Juncker responds on 03/03/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has vowed to fight back against US President Donald Trump’s threat of a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium imports (see Figure 1.15).\n“So now we will also impose import tariffs. This is basically a stupid process, the fact that we have to do this. But we have to do it. We will now impose tariffs on motorcycles, Harley Davidson, on blue jeans, Levis, on Bourbon. We can also do stupid. We also have to be this stupid,” he said in Hamburg on Friday evening.\nWhile Trump may be comfortable with the idea of a trade war, it wasn’t just across the Atlantic where the leader’s plans ruffled feathers.\n“We are impressing upon the American administration the unacceptable nature of these proposals that are going to hurt them every bit as much as they will hurt us,” said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nThe warnings from leaders around the world mirrored those of the International Monetary Fund, which said Trump’s plan would cause damage both internationally and within America itself.\nTrump, however, remains defiant, insisting that trade wars are good and easy to win.\n\nWatch this video.

In academia, it is a widely shared belief that free trade can be (don’t have to be!) a positive-sum game. Outside of academia, however, many people fear international trade because they might loose their competitive advantage in business or their jobs to foreign competitors. Nevertheless, it has to be stated that consumers decide to buy a lot of items from foreign suppliers without being forced to do so. Politicians take advantage of the topic to make popular statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.1 Glossary of terms in international economics\n\nTrade: Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.\nInternational trade: International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories.\nExport: An export in international trade is a good or service produced in one country that is bought by someone in another country. The seller of such goods and services is an exporter; the foreign buyer is an importer.\nImport: An import in the receiving country is an export from the sending country. Importation and exportation are the defining financial transactions of international trade.\nBalance of trade: The balance of trade, commercial balance, or net exports (sometimes symbolized as NX), is the difference between the monetary value of a nation’s exports and imports over a certain time period.\nTrade deficit/surplus: If a country exports a greater value than it imports, it has a trade surplus or positive trade balance; conversely, if a country imports a greater value than it exports, it has a trade deficit or negative trade balance.\nBalance of payments: The balance of payments, also known as balance of international payments and abbreviated B.O.P. or BoP, of a country is the record of all economic transactions between the residents of the country and the rest of the world in a particular period of time (e.g., a quarter of a year). These transactions are made by individuals, firms, and government bodies. Thus, the balance of payments includes all external visible and non-visible transactions of a country. It is an important issue to be studied, especially in the international financial management field.\nTrade barrier: Trade barriers are government-induced restrictions on international trade.\nTariff: A tariff is a tax on imports or exports between sovereign states. It is a form of regulation of foreign trade and a policy that taxes foreign products to encourage or safeguard domestic industry. Traditionally, states have used them as a source of income. They are now among the most widely used instruments of protectionism, along with import and export quotas.\nTrade war: A trade war is an economic conflict resulting from extreme protectionism in which states raise or create tariffs or other trade barriers against each other in response to trade barriers created by the other party.\nProtectionism: Protectionism is the economic policy of restricting imports from other countries through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, import quotas, and a variety of other government regulations.\nAutarky: Autarky is the characteristic of self-sufficiency; the term usually applies to political states or their economic systems. Autarky exists whenever an entity survives or continues its activities without external assistance or international trade.\nClosed economy: If a self-sufficient economy also refuses to conduct any trade with the outside world, then economists may term it a “closed economy.”\nProduction-possibility frontier: A production–possibility frontier (PPF) or production possibility curve (PPC) is a curve that shows various combinations of the amounts of two goods that can be produced within the given resources and technology— a graphical representation showing all the possible options of output for two products that can be produced using all factors of production, where the given resources are fully and efficiently utilized per unit time.\nIndifference curve: In economics, an indifference curve connects points on a graph representing different quantities of two goods, points between which a consumer is indifferent. That is, any combinations of two products indicated by the curve will provide the consumer with equal levels of utility, and the consumer has no preference for one combination or bundle of goods over a different combination on the same curve.\nUtility: Within economics, the concept of utility is used to model worth or value. Its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or satisfaction within the theory of utilitarianism by moral philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. The term has been adapted and reapplied within neoclassical economics, which dominates modern economic theory, as a utility function that represents a consumer’s preference ordering over a choice set. It is devoid of its original interpretation as a measurement of the pleasure or satisfaction obtained by the consumer from that choice.",

    "text": "2.1 The rational model\nLearning objectives:\nStudents will be able to:\nA choice can be considered as a rational one when a individual decides for the best alternative courses of action. That is, the alternative with the greatest benefit over cost for the individual making the choice. Whatever the benefits and the costs maybe, a decision maker has to consider all and make a decision. Of course, in reality it is often difficult if not impossible to sum up benefits and costs as the nature of both may be totally different. That is what makes decision often so difficult.\nThe nature of costs and benefits is manifold and emotions in general are hard to quantify and take as a basis for a decision. To deal with that economists use a theoretical concept that measures everything in utility. That is a general and abstract measure to model worth or value. Its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or happiness within the theory of utilitarianism. For example, it represents the satisfaction or pleasure that people receive for consuming a bundle of goods and services.\nThe rational model assumes that actors always act in a way that maximizes their utility (as consumers) and profit (as producers) and that they are capable of arbitrarily complex considerations. This means that they consider all possible outcomes and choose the course of action that leads to the best result. In economics, this is known as the homo economicus assumption, which is a paraphrase of the assumption of perfect rationality. Of course, this assumption is highly idealized, and it is doubtful that any serious economist has ever believed it to be completely true in reality. It is important to understand the limitations of this assumption in order to make good decisions. Therefore, we will discuss the limitations in detail later. All in all, it is a useful assumption that is indispensable in theoretical research and simplifies many things in practical analysis. It makes it possible to make predictions and explain behavior to a certain extent.\nHere is an example of a logical and systematic sequence of steps for making a decision, as outlined similarly by Fitzgerald (2002, p. 13):",

    "text": "Definition: Rational decision\n\n\n\nA rational decision is the result of a logical and systematic process in which the decision-maker evaluates\n\nall relevant and available information about\nall possible courses of action (a.k.a., alternatives) and\nall their potential outcomes,\n\naiming to choose the option that maximizes utility, where utility increases with benefits and decreases with costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly identify the problem. A problem is defined as the perceived gap between the current situation and the desired outcome.\nGenerate potential solutions. For routine decisions, various alternatives can be easily identified using established decision rules. However, non-routine decisions require a creative process to discover new alternatives.\nSelect a solution. Using appropriate analytical approaches, choose the alternative with the highest expected value. In decision theory, this is referred to as maximizing the expected utility of the outcomes.\nImplement the solution. Successful implementation requires ensuring that those responsible understand and accept their roles, and have the necessary motivation and resources for success.\nEvaluate and improve. Assess the effectiveness of the decision and refine the process for future improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.1 Poor and irrational decisions\nPeople make poor decisions all the time. They smoke, take drugs, and harm themself in various ways, make seemingly stupid things that they regret instantaneously. Do all these people act irrational? And, what is a poor decision? What is a stupid thing? The more you think about all that the more challenging it becomes to stay within a logically consistent framework where the meaning of words doesn’t change.\nDiscuss whether taking drugs can be considered a rational choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking drugs are usually considered to be a “stupid” idea because drugs (if not taken for medical purpose) usually don’t solve problems and causes addiction and bad side effects. However they may give some sort of relieve for some short period of time. Thus, taking drugs can be considered as a rational choice for people that have strong time preferences (i.e., people that can’t take the (emotional) pain now and want to postpone it), don’t fear side effects, and have little or no hope that things will get better later or that taking any other alternative would help them solving their problem. For those people it is, at least from their perspective, a rational choice.\nOverall, I would tend to argue that taking drugs can be a rational choice if these individuals consider all (!) alternative and all (!) information available and if they analyze all (!) relevant aspects without a bias.\nIf all that hold, we can disagree and we can try our best to convince these individuals that there are better alternative courses of action. Of course, we can and I believe, we should support those human beings not taking drugs. For example, we can teach them to be more optimistic and hence weight the chances that problems can be solved better. However, we cannot claim that their decision is irrational given the conditions mentioned above hold.\nOften the conditions to not hold as desperate people are not capable to use all the information without a bias. This gives bystanders such as relatives, friends, and other authorities the legitimate to interfere. For example, doctors and national authorities can send people that are not capable to act rational to a psychological institute until they have the ability to rationally make a decision.",

    "text": "2.2 Irrationality\nWhile the rational model is useful, it can also be criticized in a number of ways. One key misconception is that managers always optimize their decisions through rationality, consciously selecting and implementing the best alternatives. However, this belief rests on several questionable assumptions, as outlined by Fitzgerald (2002, p. 13):\n\nFitzgerald, S. P. (2002). Decision making. Capstone Publishing.\n\nIt is rarely possible to know in advance all possible alternative solutions and predict their specific outcomes.\nThe assumption that there is always an optimal solution among the identified alternatives may not hold true.\nAccurately and numerically weighting the alternatives, their outcome probabilities, and the relative desirability of these outcomes is often impractical.\nDecision-makers are not always purely rational; emotions, biases, and organizational politics frequently influence the process.\nBusiness decisions are not exclusively driven by the desire to maximize profits.\n\nThe rational model is considered normative because it prescribes a strict, logical sequence of steps to follow in any decision-making process. It is based on the assumption that human behavior is logical and therefore predictable in certain conditions. However, this doesn’t always reflect real-world decision-making. For example, findings from behavioral economics reveal that the concept of homo economicus, while useful, is flawed in several key aspects.\nAfter all, what would happen if economics adopted the opposite extreme, assuming individuals act irrationally? If actors behaved randomly and unpredictably, we would struggle to make any predictions, and the future would resemble a random walk. Science itself would become meaningless and unnecessary.\nClearly, the extreme of irrationality isn’t a viable alternative. So, what can we do? We can identify, explain, and account for the limitations of the homo economicus assumption in both theory and empirical analysis. Economists, and anyone applying or studying economic theories, should be aware of the pitfalls in human decision-making and recognize that our ability to act rationally is often limited.",

It is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and is known as or often referred to as `Nobel Prize of Computing’.\nNobelPrize.org. (2021). Herbert A. Simon: facts: Nobel prize outreach AB. https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1978/simon/facts\n\n“combined different scientific disciplines and considered new factors in economic theories. Established economic theories held that enterprises and entrepreneurs all acted in completely rational ways, with the maximization of their own profit as their only goal. In contrast, Simon held that when making choices all people deviate from the strictly rational, and described companies as adaptable systems, with physical, personal, and social components. Through these perspectives, he was able to write about decision-making processes in modern society in an entirely new way”.\n\nIn particular, he proposed bounded rationality as an alternative basis for the mathematical and neoclassical economic modelling of decision-making, as used in economics, political science, and related disciplines.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Bounded rationality\n\n\n\nSource: https://thedecisionlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bounded-Rationality.jpg. \n\n\n\nBounded rationality proposes that decision making is constrained by managers’ ability to process information, i.e., the rationally is bounded (see figure Figure 2.2). Managers use shortcuts and rules of thumb which are based on their prior experience with similar problems and scenarios. Given the constraints of managers in their position, they do not actually optimize their choice given the available information. It is more like finding a satisfactory solution, not necessarily the best or the optimal solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2 Optimal vs. satisfactory solution\nUse the pictures of Figure 2.3 to explain the idea of bounded rationality in the context of decision making.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The idea of bounded rationality\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollecting and analyzing the available information about a product is costly.

For some people, it is simply not possible to find the best product in these complex markets.\nConsumers are often confronted with many variants of a product. The differences are negligible and therefore it is not worthwhile for consumers to analyze the situation in detail. Thus, they make a decision that may not be optimal, but they are satisfied with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3 Are we irrational?\nDiscuss the following statement:\n\nSince the rationality of individuals is bounded and it is obvious that individuals do not make optimal decisions, we can say that individuals act irrationally.",

    "text": "2.4 Heuristics\nIn real life, we frequently rely on heuristics to solve problems and make decisions. A heuristic is any approach to solving a problem that uses a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational. However, a heuristic should–at best–be sufficient to achieve an immediate, short-term goal or approximation. Overall, people use heuristics because they either cannot act completely rationally or want to act rationally but do not have the time it would take to compute the perfect solution. Moreover, the effort is probably not worth it or simply not possible given the time constraints under which the problem must be solved. A heuristic is a mental shortcut or rule of thumb to make decisions and solve problems quickly and efficiently. It helps individuals to arrive at a solution without extensive analysis or evaluation of all available information. Heuristics are usefull when time, resources, or information are limited.\nWhile heuristics can be helpful in many situations, they can also lead to errors and biases, particularly when they are overused or misapplied. We will discuss some of these biases in Chapter 16 in greater detail.",

These behavioral economic research studies the effects of psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural and social factors on the decisions of individuals and institutions and how those decisions vary from those implied by classical economic theory. While we will discover some more details about it in Chapter 16, I recommend watching the following video about the work of Tversky and Kahneman’s shown in Figure 2.5.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Kahneman and Tversky: How heuristics impact our judgment\n\n\n\nSource: Youtube\n\n\n\nThe Nobel prize winner Daniel Kahneman (1934 - 2024) is probably the most well-known figure of behavioral economics (see Figure 2.4). One reason is his best-selling book Thinking Fast and Slow where he summarizes his work for a broader audience and introduced the modes of System 1 and System 2 thinking. These two modes are easy to understand and often helpful. Figure 2.6 shows a video where he describes these two modes in his own words.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Thinking fast and thinking slow\n\n\n\nSource: Youtube\n\n\n\nSystem 1 thinking refers to our intuitive system, which is typically fast, automatic, effortless, implicit, and emotional. We make most decisions in life using this mode of thinking. For instance, we usually decide how to interpret verbal language or visual information automatically and unconsciously.\nBy contrast, System 2 refers to reasoning that is slower, conscious, effortful, explicit, and logical. In most situations, our System 1 thinking is quite sufficient; it would be impractical, for example, to logically reason through every choice we make while shopping for products in our daily life. But System 2 logic should preferably influence our most important decisions. The busier and more rushed people are, the more they have on their minds, and the more likely they are to rely on System 1 thinking. In fact, the pace of managerial life suggests that executives often rely on System 1 thinking. Although a complete System 2 process is not required for every managerial decision, a key goal for managers should be to identify situations in which they should move from the intuitively compelling System 1 thinking to the more logical System 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.4 Kahneman’s examples\nKahneman describes the two different ways the brain forms thoughts in the first section of his book as follows:\n\nSystem 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious.\nSystem 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious.\n\nBelow is a list of things that System 1 and System 2 can do. How do you perform these tasks? Do you use more of System 1 or System 2 thinking?

    "section": "3.3 Allocation of resources",
    "text": "3.3 Allocation of resources\nMarkets use prices as signals to allocate resources to their highest valued uses. Consumers will pay higher prices for goods and services that they value more highly. Producers will devote more resources to the production of goods and services that have higher prices, other things being equal. And, other things being equal, workers will provide more hours of labor to jobs that pay higher salaries.\nThis allocation principle applies to both product markets, such as those for cars, houses, and haircuts, and resource markets, including labor, land, and equipment. Individuals and households play two crucial roles in the economy: they demand goods and services and supply resources. Similarly, businesses also have dual roles; they supply goods and services while demanding resources. The interaction of demand and supply in both product and resource markets generates prices, which help allocate items to their highest valued alternatives.\nThe question of how resources can and should be allocated is a normative issue, and economists require normative criteria to make decisions. A widely accepted criterion is the Pareto principle (see Note 3.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3.1: Pareto concept\n\n\n\nAn allocation of resources is considered Pareto efficient (or Pareto optimal) when no reallocation can make at least one individual better off without making someone else worse off. In other words, it is a state where resources are allocated in such a way that it is impossible to improve one person’s situation without disadvantaging another.\nA change in allocation that benefits at least one individual without harming anyone else is known as a Pareto improvement. This improvement is often used by economist that aim to give policy advice.\n\n\nWhen economists discuss an optimal allocation of resources, they typically imply that the Pareto efficiency criterion is met, which defines optimal resource allocation as a state where no further improvements can be made without harming someone.\nFactors that disrupt the functioning of a competitive market lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, ultimately diminishing society’s overall well-being. This disruption is referred to as market failure. We will explore several forms of market failure later in the notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.1 Read and watch:\n\nMilton Friedman: “There was no commissar sending out orders from some central office. It was the magic of the price system: the impersonal operation of prices that brought them together and got them to cooperate, to make this pencil, so you could have it for a trifling sum.”\n\nFurther explanations can be found in Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4:\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Coordination Through Prices\n\n\n\nSource: Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: What if there were no prices?\n\n\n\nSource: Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.2 Magic of the price system\nExplain in your own words what Friedman means when he talks about the magic of the price system. Why is this different from Adam Smith’s invisible hand? Can you think of situations where the magic of the price system does not work properly? Can you think of necessary conditions that must be met for the “magic” to become reality?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe magic of the price system actually requires markets to be perfect.

    "section": "3.4 Assumptions",
    "text": "3.4 Assumptions\nThe assumptions of perfect markets and perfect competition are as follows:\n\nMany buyers and sellers: In a perfectly competitive market, there are numerous buyers and sellers, none of whom have a significant influence over market price. Each participant is a price taker, meaning they have no control over the price at which goods or services are exchanged.\nHomogeneous products: The products offered by all firms in a perfectly competitive market are identical or homogeneous. Consumers perceive no differences between the goods or services provided by different sellers. As a result, buyers base their purchase decisions solely on price.\nPerfect information: All buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market have complete and accurate information about prices, quality, availability, and other relevant factors. This assumption ensures that market participants can make rational decisions and respond efficiently to changes in market conditions.\nFree entry and exit: Firms can freely enter or exit the market in response to profits or losses. There are no barriers to entry or exit, such as legal restrictions or substantial costs, that prevent new firms from entering the market or existing firms from leaving it.\nPerfect mobility of factors of production: The resources used in production, such as labor and capital, can move freely between different firms and industries. There are no constraints on the mobility of factors of production, allowing firms to allocate resources efficiently.\nProfit maximization: All firms in a perfectly competitive market are profit maximizers. They aim to maximize their profits by adjusting their output levels based on prevailing market conditions. If firms can increase their profits, they will expand production, and if they incur losses, they will reduce output or exit the market.\nNo externalities and no transaction costs: There are assumed to be no externalities, meaning no external costs or benefits to third parties not involved in the transaction.\n\nThese assumptions collectively define perfect competition. When all conditions are met, there is no need for government regulation, as welfare is maximized, resources are allocated optimally, and no Pareto improvement can be achieved.\nWhile perfect competition is never fully realized in the real world, it serves as a valuable theoretical model that acts as a benchmark for analyzing actual markets. This model provides insights into market functioning and helps inform policymakers on how to address instances of market failure, where at least one assumption of perfect markets is not met.\nIt is important to note that the fact that real markets are usually imperfect does not imply that such imperfect markets necessarily fail or perform worse than centrally planned economies, for example.\nTheory would predict that if firms in an industry would make some profits, new firms will enter the market or existing firms would produce more which both yields an increase in supply. That, in turn, will drive down market prices until all firms earn zero profits and no more firms would have an incentive to enter the market. In the equilibrium, total revenue equals total cost. Thus, firms do not make profits. Firms can only make profits if they have some sort of competitive advantage and hence are not price takers which would be against assumption 1. The most extreme form of competitive advantage is a monopoly. It describes that one firm is the only provider of a certain good or service. This firm can set prices and the supply of the good and service completely. We will discuss that extreme case in Chapter 14.",

Distinguishing between these two concepts can be challenging, and practitioners often use the terms interchangeably.\nA theory is a set of assumptions that aims to explain a particular phenomenon in nature. It must be possible to prove a theory true or false. In contrast, a model is a purposeful representation of reality. Models typically simplify the complexities of the real world by focusing only on the features that are relevant to the specific purpose at hand. Their goal is to reduce complexity, thereby facilitating a better understanding of the world. Furthermore, models assist in identifying key variables that can be empirically examined.\nThe art of scientific thinking and the construction of a theory or model lies in deciding which assumptions to make. Once we grasp the foundational model or theory, we can begin to relax or modify some of those assumptions.\nFor example, to understand how consumers make purchasing decisions, it may be helpful to start with the assumption that there are only two distinct goods and that the sole determinant of consumers’ decisions is price. When we test our model against real data, we will likely find that while price accounts for a significant portion of consumer behavior, it does not explain everything. We can then refine our theory to enhance the explanatory power of our model.\nA model typically includes endogenous variables, whose values are determined within the model, and exogenous variables, whose values are set externally by the researcher.\nIn the words of Nobel laureate Robert Solow:",

    "text": "4.2 A didactical note on models\nIn these note, I introduce some mathematical economic models. I strongly believe that these models are useful for thinking about economics in a structured way. Familiarity with them will enable you to engage with contemporary textbooks and literature. The models including their formulas and their graphical visualizations, can assist in understanding, analyzing, and memorizing the more complex facets of economics.\nEconomic models are built on transparent assumptions. Often these assumptions are formulated in a set of equations. A good model should provide valuable insights into how rational agents behave and how the economy functions. Unfortunately, students often feel overwhelmed by these models, as the application of mathematics and hence rigorous logical thinking is sort of new to them. I frequently hear that there are simpler ways to convey the argument. While there may be some truth to this, I firmly believe that formally introducing international economics is the most effective approach in the medium and long term. Allow me to justify my conviction:\n\nThe narrative method, such as telling stories and listing bullet points, efficiently informs about different topics but also has its drawbacks. Students can easily get lost in intuitive anecdotes without learning to think critically or identify underlying driving forces. They often cram the presented information only for exams and forget it shortly afterward.\nCompared to anecdotes, formal models are not necessarily true, yet they provide deeper insights into topics than anecdotal storytelling.\nA formal model is usually more flexible than stories or anecdotes. Once students grasp the underlying logic of a model and can interpret and evaluate its meaning, they can apply their findings to various circumstances or problems. In contrast, an anecdote is merely a story that offers a limited perspective. Drawing general conclusions and analogies from anecdotal evidence is problematic.\nA mathematical economic model represents a proof of an argument, precisely stating the assumptions under which the argument holds true. In a narrative, the underlying assumptions and premises of an argument are often obscured.\nFormal reasoning is the standard in economic research. By understanding the basic concepts, students can read and comprehend current literature, allowing them to conduct research and solve problems in their professional lives.\nOnce students understand an economic model, they grasp the underlying relationships, making it less likely for them to forget. In other words, a formal model ensures that students are not merely repeating the teacher’s words but are capable of thinking and reasoning independently.",

At the age of 25, he became a group leader of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965, authored one of the most famous science books of our time (Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!) (Feynman, 1985), and remains a hero for many enthusiasts, educators, and nerds (see Figure 4.1). In 1964, more than half a century ago, he gave a good description of scientific method which is still worth considering.\n\nFeynman, R. P. (1985). Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman! Adventures of a curious character. W.W. Norton.\nWatch the video Feynman on scientific method:\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Feynman on scientific method\n\n\n\nSource: Youtube\n\n\n\nHere is a transcript of his lecture:\n\n“Now, I’m going to discuss how we would look for a new law. In general, we look for a new law by the following process. First, we guess it.\nThen we—well, don’t laugh. That’s really true. Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see if this law that we guessed is right. We check what it would imply and compare those computed results to nature. Or we compare it to experiments or experiences, comparing it directly with observations to see if it works.\nIf it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. And that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn’t matter how beautiful your guess is. It doesn’t matter how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is; if it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it.\nIt’s therefore not unscientific to take a guess, although many people outside of science think it is. For instance, I had a conversation about flying saucers a few years ago with laymen.\nBecause I’m a scientist, I said, ‘I don’t think there are flying saucers.’ Then my antagonist said, ‘Is it impossible that there are flying saucers? Can you prove that it’s impossible?’ I said, ‘No, I can’t prove it’s impossible. It’s just very unlikely.’\nThey replied, ‘You are very unscientific. If you can’t prove something is impossible, then how can you say it’s unlikely?’ Well, that’s how science works. It’s scientific to say what’s more likely or less likely, rather than attempting to prove every possibility and impossibility.\nTo clarify, I concluded by saying, ’From my understanding of the world around me, I believe it’s much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the result of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence rather than the unknown rational efforts of extraterrestrial intelligence. It’s just more likely, that’s all. And it’s a good guess. We always try to guess the most likely explanation, keeping in the back of our minds that if it doesn’t work, we must consider other possibilities.\n[…]\nNow, you see, of course, that with this method, we can disprove any specific theory. We can have a definite theory or a real guess from which we can compute consequences that could be compared to experiments, and in principle, we can discard any theory. You can always prove any definite theory wrong. Notice, however, we never prove it right.\nSuppose you invent a good guess, calculate the consequences, and find that every consequence matches the experiments. Does that mean your theory is right? No, it simply has not been proved wrong. Because in the future, there could be a wider range of experiments, and you may compute a broader range of consequences that could reveal that your theory is actually incorrect.\nThat’s why laws, like Newton’s laws of motion for planets, have lasted for such a long time. He guessed the law of gravitation, calculated various consequences for the solar system, and it took several hundred years before the slight error in the motion of Mercury was discovered.\n[…]\nI must also point out that you cannot prove a vague theory wrong. If the guess you make is poorly expressed and rather vague, and if the method you use to compute the consequences is also vague—you aren’t sure. You might say, ‘I think everything is due to [INAUDIBLE], and [INAUDIBLE] does this and that,’ more or less. Thus, you can explain how this works. However, that theory is considered ‘good’ because it cannot be proved wrong.\nIf the process for computing the consequences is indefinite, then with a little skill, any experimental result can be made to fit—at least in theory. You’re probably familiar with that in other fields. For example, A hates his mother. The reason is, of course, that she didn’t show him enough love or care when he was a child. However, upon investigation, you may find that she actually loved him very much and everything was fine. Then the explanation changes to say she was overindulgent when he was [INAUDIBLE]. With a vague theory, it’s possible to arrive at either conclusion.\n[APPLAUSE]\nNow, wait. The cure for this is the following: it would be possible to specify ahead of time how much love is insufficient and how much constitutes overindulgence precisely, enabling a legitimate theory against which you can conduct tests. It’s often said that when this is pointed out regarding how much love is involved, you’re dealing with psychological matters, and such things can’t be defined so precisely. Yes, but then you can’t claim to know anything about it. [APPLAUSE]\nNow, I want to concentrate for now on—because I’m a theoretical physicist and more fascinated with this end of the problem—how you make guesses. It is irrelevant where the guess originates. What matters is that it agrees with experiments and is as precise as possible.\nBut, you might say, that’s very simple. We just set up a machine—a great computing machine—with a random wheel that makes a succession of guesses. Each time it guesses hypotheses about how nature should work, it computes the consequences and compares them to a list of experimental results at the other end. In other words, guessing is a task for simpletons.\nActually, it’s quite the opposite, and I will try to explain why. […]",

    "text": "4.4 The economic way of doing research\nEconomics is a social science. When economists are trying to …\n\n…change the world, they act as policy advisors.\n…explain the world, they are scientists.\n\nEconomists distinguish between two types of statements:\n\nA positive statement attempts to describe the world as it is and can be tested by checking it against facts. In other words, a positive statement deals with assumptions about the state of the world and some conclusions. The validity of the statement is verifiable or testable in principle, no matter how difficult it might be.\nA normative statement claims how the world should be and cannot be tested. Normative statements often contain words such as have to, ought to, must, should, or non-quantifiable adjectives like important, which cannot be objectively measured. Consequently, normative statements cannot be verified or falsified by scientific methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.1 Positive or normative\n\nAn increase in the minimum wage will cause a decrease in employment among the least-skilled.\nHigher federal budget deficits will cause interest rates to increase.\nNobody should be paid less due to their gender, race, age, or religion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe task of economic science is to discover positive statements that align with our observations of the world and enable us to understand how the economic world operates. This task is substantial and can be broken into three steps:\n\nObservation and measurement: Economists observe and measure economic activity, tracking data such as quantities of resources, wages and work hours, prices and quantities of goods and services produced, taxes and government spending, and the volume and price of traded goods.\nModel building\nTesting models\n\nResearch methodologies in economics often blend the inductive and deductive approaches. Inductive reasoning builds theories, while deductive reasoning tests existing ones. It’s a methodical interplay between creation and scrutiny in the realm of economic research.\nWhen scientists want to act as political advisors, they are often asked to make normative statements. From an ethical point of view, however, it is difficult to make normative statements without including subjective judgments, which can make such statements unscientific. Therefore, scientists should rely on moral criteria to justify their judgments and normative statements.\nAmong these criteria, the Pareto criterion is one of the best known and most widely used. It states that only changes that benefit at least one individual without harming others can be considered improvements. This concept is often used in economics to discuss the distribution of resources, welfare economics and policy making.",

    "text": "4.5 Cause and effect\nEconomists seek to unscramble cause and effect. They are particularly interested in positive statements concerning causal relationships. For example, are computers becoming cheaper because people are purchasing them in greater quantities, or are consumers buying more computers because prices are falling? Alternatively, could a third factor be influencing both the price of computers and the quantity sold? To address these questions, economists develop and test economic and econometric models.\nUnfortunately, conducting experiments can be challenging for economists, and most economic behaviors are influenced by multiple simultaneous factors. To isolate the effect of interest, they employ various logical and econometric tools, including the ceteris paribus assumption, which means other things being equal. This approach enables economists to delineate cause-and-effect relationships by varying only one variable at a time while keeping all other relevant factors constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading tip: Huber (2025)\n\n\n\nMy lecture notes on quantitative methods covers these concepts in detail.\n\n\n\nHuber, S.

However, this does not mean that the presence of storks causes an increase in the birth rate. It is possible that both the number of storks and the number of babies born are influenced by other factors, such as the overall population density or economic conditions in the area.\n\nMatthews, R.

Still, I want to take this opportunity to pause for a moment and alert you to the fact that many economists have strong and conflicting views about what economic theory is.

Therefore, the equation - which is often called the GDP decomposition - is:\n\\[GDP = C + I + G + (X - M),\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(C\\) denote the expenditure on all consumer goods,\n\\(I\\) denotes the expenditure on newly produced capital goods,\n\\(G\\) denotes government expenditure on goods and services (excluding transfers),\n\\(X\\) denotes the exports, and \\(M\\) the imports. The difference \\(X-M\\) stands for the net exports, also known as the trade balance. For example, for the USA in 2020, this amounts to: \\[\\$14,145 + \\$3,605 + \\$3,831 + (-\\$645) = \\$20,936.\\] Aggregate expenditure equals GDP because all goods and services produced are sold to households, firms, governments, or foreigners.

This sum equals net domestic income at factor costs. To obtain GDP, indirect taxes (taxes paid by consumers when they buy goods and services) minus subsidies are included along with depreciation. Finally, any discrepancy between the expenditure approach and the income approach is included in the income approach as a statistical discrepancy.\n\n\n5.2.3 The production approach\nThe production approach calculates how much value is contributed at each stage of production. (Gross value added = gross value of output - value of intermediate consumption.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\nAre government transfer payments part of the GDP?\nGovernment transfer payments, such as Social Security payments, are not included in government expenditures because they do not involve the government buying goods or services.\nHow do we account for international transactions?\nFor example, foreign production is domestic consumption (imports), while domestic production is foreign consumption (exports).\nWe include exports and exclude imports, so that GDP reflects value added, income from, or consumption of, domestic production.\nHow do we incorporate government?\nTreat it as another producer where public services are bought via taxes.\nWhy “domestic” and why “gross”?\n\nDepreciation refers to the decrease in the stock of capital due to wear and tear and obsolescence. The total spent on new capital purchases and replacing depreciated capital is termed gross investment. The increase in capital stock is termed net investment.\n\nNet investment = gross investment - depreciation.\n\nThe term “gross” in gross domestic product signifies that the investment in GDP is gross investment, part of which replaces depreciating capital. Net domestic product subtracts depreciation from GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.1 How to measure GDP Explain in one sentence the three equivalent ways to measure GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the expenditure approach, GDP is calculated as the sum of all expenditure on final products.\nIn the income approach, GDP is calculated as the sum of all income.\nIn the value-added approach, GDP is calculated as the sum of all value added in all production units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.2 Part of GDP?\nState which of the following are a part of the GDP and which are not:\n\nSocial security payments received by a retired factory worker.\nUnpaid services of a family member in painting the family home.\nThe income of a butcher.\nThe monthly allowance a college student receives from home.\nRent received on an apartment.\nA €2 million increase in business inventories.\nInterest on a BMW bond.\nThe purchase of an insurance policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial security payments received by a retired factory worker.\n\nPart of GDP\n\nNot Part of GDP\n\nUnpaid services of a family member in painting the family home.\n\nPart of GDP\n\nNot Part of GDP\n\nThe income of a butcher.\n\nPart of GDP\n\nNot Part of GDP\n\nThe monthly allowance a college student receives from home.\n\nPart of GDP\n\nNot Part of GDP\n\nRent received on an apartment.\n\nPart of GDP\n\nNot Part of GDP\n\nA €2 million increase in business inventories.\n\nPart of GDP\n\nNot Part of GDP\n\nInterest on a BMW bond.\n\nPart of GDP\n\nNot Part of GDP\n\nThe purchase of an insurance policy.\n\nPart of GDP\n\nNot Part of GDP",

Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: File:simon kuznets 1971b.jpg. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simon_Kuznets_1971b.jpg\n\n\n\n\nThe GDP as a single measure for economic activity and production, respectively, was pioneered and developed by a Russian-born American economist, Simon Kuznets (1901-1985), see Figure 5.7. He received the Nobel Prize in economics in 1971 for his contributions. While he was convinced about the valuable uses of national income measurements, he was very much aware of the limitations and the risks of the measures to be abused. In an report to the U.S. Senate where he explains the possibilities of a national income measure, he warns in the section “Uses and Abuses of National Income Measurements” (Kuznets, 1934, pp. 5–8) that the GDP needs to be “interpreted with a full realization of the definition of national income assumed”Kuznets (1934, p. 6). Otherwise it is abused. Please read here his carefull warning:\n\nKuznets, S. (1934). National income, 1929-32: Letter from the acting secretary of commerce transmitting in response to senate resolution no. 220 (72D cong.) a report on national income, 1929-32 (124). Senate, 73rd Congress, 2d session. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/national-income-1929-1932-971\n\n“The valuable capacity of the human mind to simplify a complex situation in a compact characterization becomes dangerous when not controlled in terms of definitely stated criteria. With quantitative measurements especially, the definiteness of the result suggests, often misleadingly, a precision and simplicity in the outlines of the object measured. Measurements of national income are subject to this type of illusion and resulting abuse, especially since they deal with matters that are the center of conflict of opposing social groups where the effectiveness of an argument is often contingent upon oversimplification.\nFrom the definition of national income presented and discussed above it is obvious that a measure of income produced sheds a good deal of light on the productivity of the nation; that income received measures the same productivity as reflected in the flow of means of purchase to the nation’s members; and that when total income paid out is adjusted for changes in the value of money and apportioned per capita, the result is illuminating of movements in the nation’s economic welfare. Comparison of such income measurements for different nations, or for the same nation for different years, yields valuable indications of spatial and temporal differences in national productivity and economic welfare. Moreover, various single groups of services or drafts may be compared with the country’s total to indicate their relative weight in or draft upon the latter.\nThese constitute highly valuable uses of national income measurements, but only if the results are interpreted with a full realization of the definition of national income assumed, either explicitly or implicitly, by the measurement. Thus, the estimates submitted in the present study define income in such a way as to cover primarily only efforts whose results appear on the market place of our economy. A student of social affairs who is interested in the total productivity of the nation, including those efforts which, like housewives’ services, do not appear on the market, can therefore use our measures only with some qualifications. Secondly, the present study’s measures of national income, like all such studies, estimates the value of commodities and direct services at their market price. But market valuation of commodities and especially of direct services depends upon the personal distribution of income within the nation. Thus in a nation with a rich upper class, the personal services to the rich are likely to be valued at a much higher level than the very same services in another nation, characterized by a more equitable personal distribution of income. A student of social affairs who conceives of a nation’s end-product as undistorted by the existing distribution of income, yould again have to qualify and change our estimates, possibly in a marked fashion. Thirdly, the present study’s estimate of national income produced is based in part, like most existing estimates, upon the prevalent legal and accounting distinction between gross and net income of business enterprises. To a student of social affairs whose concept of net productivity does not agree with the prevailing practices of separating net from gross income, especially by corporations, our estimates will obviously present a somewhat distorted picture of the nation’s net product.\nAll these qualifications upon estimates of national income as an index of productivity are just as important when income measurements are interpreted from the point of view of economic welfare. But in the latter case additional difficulties will be suggested to anyone who wants to penetrate below the surface of total figures and market values. Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known. And no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income, that is, the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income. The welfare of a nation can, therefore, scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above.\nThe abuses of national income estimates arise largely from a failure to take into account the precise definition of income and the methods of its evaluation which the estimator assumes in arriving at his final figures. Notions of productivity or welfare as understood by the user of the estimates are often read by him into the income measurement, regardless of the assumptions made by the income estimator in arriving at the figures. As a result we find all too commonly such inferences that a decline of 30 percent in the national income (in terms of “constant” dollars) means a 30 percent decline in the total productivity of the nation, and a corresponding decline in its welfare. Or that a nation whose total income is twice the size of the national income of another country is twice “as well off”, can sustain payments abroad twice as large or can carry a debt burden double in size. Such statements can obviously be true only when gualified by a host of “ifs.”\nA similar failure to take into account the investigator’s basic assumptions underlies another widely prevalent abuse of national income measures, involved in estimating the draft or “burden” which this or that particular type of expenses (e.g., government expenses, payments on bonded debt, etc.) constitutes ot the country’s total end-product. Every payment included in the national income is ipso facto a draft or a “burden” upon national income. For example, net receipts by physicians from medical practice, are both an addition to national income and a draft upon individual incomes from which such receipts originate. Since we estimate the value of personal services or commodities at their market value it follows that any payment for productive services contributes just as much to the national income total as it takes away from it. No items included in national income can, therefore, be conceived as “pure” draft.\nThe full meaning of a statement that such payments as interest on bonds or taxes for government services are a ” burden” or draft upon national income is that actually no services are being rendered in return for these payments. That an increasing weight in the national income of payments on fixed debt or of salaries of government officials is not hailed as an increased contribution to national income lies in the implicit assumption, not always true, that the services contributed by creditors or government officials have not increased proportionately, and that, therefore, a heavier burden was added upon other income recipients without an increased benefit.\nSuch assumptions are accepted all too easily because they are based upon a natural but erroneous identification of national income with business or personal income. From the standpoint of a business firm or person, the income of employees, private or public, is likely to appear as a draft. But from the vantage point of national economy as a whole, which is used by a national income investigator, no payment that is included in national income can be considered as a pure draft upon the country’s end-product. This can be true only of payments not included, such as charity, earnings from illegal pursuits, and the like. All that the national income estimator can say is that this or the other part of the national total has increased or declined more than the others. That this rise or decline implies a larger or smaller burden upon the national economy can be established only on the basis of such additional assumptions as have been formulated above, assumptions which arc not a proper part of the national income estimate and which are far from being self-evident.”\n\nIn a nutshell, GDP is an imperfect measure of production as it overlooks significant parts of economic activity. For example, it does not account for black market activity, private production, and production that occurs outside formal markets. While GDP is often used to gauge a country’s welfare or the well-being and happiness of its citizens, it neglects factors considered essential to these concepts, which are inherently difficult to define.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.3 GDP as an imperfect measure\n\n\nWatch the video Robert F. Kennedy challenges Gross Domestic Product or read the speech of Robert Kennedy below and discuss what factors influencing the standard of living are not included in GDP and how that may impact GDP:\n\n“Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman’s rifle and Speck’s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. […] it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”\n– Senator Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968) (see Kennedy, 1968)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Factors omitted from GDP\n\n\n\n\n\nSome aspects that influence the standard of living are not part of GDP. These include:\n\nNon-market transactions: Household production, such as childcare services, is excluded from GDP. As more services, including childcare, are provided in the marketplace, the measured growth rate might overstate the development of overall economic activity.\nBlack-market activities: Although the level of GDP may be underestimated if the underground economy is a stable proportion of total economic activity, the growth rate itself should remain accurate.\nLeisure Time: An increase in leisure time may lower the economic growth rate, but individuals may value their leisure and feel better off as a result.\nEnvironmental Quality: Pollution does not directly diminish the economic growth rate, even though it may lower living standards.\nInequality: GDP fails to account for income inequality within society.\nSustainability: GDP does not reflect the sustainability of economic growth.\nHealth and environment: GDP overlooks the health of individuals and the environment in general.\nDepreciation replacement: GDP does not consider how much capital (tangible goods) has depreciated. For example, while GDP measures the construction of new bridges, it does not account for bridges that have been decommissioned. It is not a balance sheet of prosperity but a measure of the inflow of new production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKennedy, R. F. (1968).

    "text": "5.4 Nominal and real GDP\nPlease watch the video of Figure 5.8.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.8: Nominal vs. Real GDP\n\n\n\nSource: Youtube\n\n\n\nNominal GDP reflects the value of final goods and services produced in a specific year, valued at the prices prevalent during that year. The overall market value of production and thus GDP can rise either through increased output of goods and services or through higher prices. In contrast, the real GDP enables the comparison of production quantities across different time periods, as it represents the value of final goods and services produced in a year, valued at the prices of a reference base year. This relationship is expressed as:\n\\[GDP^{\\text{real}}=\\frac{GDP^{\\text{nominal}}}{P}\\]\nWhile nominal GDP is the commonly reported figure and does not account for price adjustments, real GDP provides somehow a more accurate reflection of the actual quantity of goods and services produced. The real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure that captures the value of all goods and services produced by an economy in a given year, expressed in base-year prices. It is often referred to as constant-price GDP, inflation-corrected GDP, or constant dollar GDP. A clear definition can be found on Wikipedia (2020):\n\nWikipedia. (2020). Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: Real gross domestic product. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_gross_domestic_product\n\n“Real gross domestic product (real gdp for short) is a macroeconomic measure of the value of economic output adjusted for price changes (i.e., inflation or deflation). This adjustment transforms the money-value measure, nominal GDP, into an index for quantity of total output.”\n\nTo clarify the concept of the real GDP, consider the two following examples where we suppose the economy produces only one product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A: Prices change\n\n\n\nProduction and prices are as shown in Table 5.1:\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: No quantity changes\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nNumber\nPrice in Euro\n\n\n\n\n2010\n500\n1\n\n\n2011\n500\n1.1\n\n\n2012\n500\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNominal GDP:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nGDP_{2010}^{nominal} &= 500 \\cdot 1 \\text{€} = 500\\text{€}\\\\\nGDP_{2011}^{nominal} &= 500 \\cdot 1.1 \\text{€} = 550\\text{€}\\\\\nGDP_{2012}^{nominal} &= 500 \\cdot 1.2 \\text{€}= 600\\text{€}\n\\end{align}\\]\nReal GDP with a base year 2010:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nGDP_{2010}^{real, base=2010} = 500 \\cdot 1\\text{€} = 500 \\text{€} \\\\\nGDP_{2011}^{real, base=2010} = 500 \\cdot 1\\text{€} = 500 \\text{€}  \\\\\nGDP_{2012}^{real, base=2010} = 500 \\cdot 1\\text{€} = 500 \\text{€}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B: Prices and quantity change\n\n\n\nThe production and prices are as shown in Table 5.2:\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Price and quantity changes\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nNumber\nPrice in Euro\n\n\n\n\n2010\n500\n1\n\n\n2011\n600\n1.1\n\n\n2012\n700\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNominal GDP: \\[\\begin{align}\nGDP_{2010} = 500 \\cdot 1\\text{€}   = 500 \\text{€}  \\\\\nGDP_{2011} = 600 \\cdot 1.1\\text{€}   = 660 \\text{€}  \\\\\nGDP_{2012} = 700 \\cdot 1.2\\text{€}   = 840 \\text{€}  \n\\end{align}\\] Real GDP with a base year of 2010: \\[\\begin{align}\nGDP_{2010}^{base=2010} = 500 \\cdot 1\\text{€}   = 500 \\text{€}  \\\\\nGDP_{2011}^{base=2010} = 600 \\cdot 1\\text{€}   = 600 \\text{€}  \\\\\nGDP_{2012}^{base=2010} = 700 \\cdot 1\\text{€}   = 700 \\text{€}  \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe examples above simplify reality by assuming that only one item is being produced in the economy, while, in fact, many goods and services are produced. Despite this limitation, the examples illustrate two important points. First, it is crucial to identify a representative basket of goods produced in an economy. Second, it is essential to measure the prices of this basket accurately. Both of these aspects will be discussed in Chapter 6. Afterward, we will return to evaluating GDP as a measure of welfare in Chapter 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.4 Various GDP\n\nTo estimate GDP, you add the value of all goods and services produced, both final and intermediate goods. Is this procedure correct? Why?\nWhat is the relationship between aggregate income and aggregate production? Why does this relationship exist?\nDoes my purchase of a domestically produced Ford automobile that was manufactured in 2020 add to the current U.S. GDP? Why? How about my purchase of a domestically produced, newly produced Ford? Why?\nDoes my purchase of 100 shares of stock in Meta add to the nation’s GDP? Why?\nIf a homeowner cuts their lawn, is the value of this work included in real GDP? Suppose the homeowner hires a neighborhood kid to cut the lawn. Is this activity included in real GDP? Comment on your answers.\nIn 1900, the average work week was 65 hours; today it is approximately 35 hours. How did this change affect real GDP within the United States? How did it affect the standard of living within the United States? Comment on your answers.\nIn the United States, many children receive daycare from commercial providers. In Africa, this is uncommon; children are almost all cared for by relatives. How would this difference affect comparisons of GDP per person?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the value of all goods and services produced is incorrect because it leads to significant double counting. Intermediate goods and services will be counted multiple times; for example, a CPU produced by Intel and then used in a Dell computer could be counted as both a CPU from Intel and as part of the computer from Dell.\nAggregate income equals aggregate production. The circular flow shows this result: the flow of production out of business firms equals the flow of expenditure into business firms, which equals the flow of costs out of business firms, which is the same as the flow of aggregate income to households.\nThe purchase of the used Ford does not add to current U.S. GDP as it was not produced in the current year; however, a new Ford automobile is counted in current U.S. GDP because it was produced during the current year.\nPurchasing shares of stock does not add to the nation’s GDP, as GDP measures production. Shares of stock are not the production of a good or service and, therefore, are not included in GDP.\nThe homeowner’s work around their home is not included in GDP because home production is excluded. Hiring a neighborhood kid to cut the lawn is included in GDP because it is a service that has been sold in a market. This illustrates a flaw in GDP computation; the same lawn is mowed regardless of payment, yet GDP is unaffected in one case and increases in the other.\nThe decrease in the average work week will likely decrease real GDP, as less time is spent producing goods and services. This could imply a lower standard of living. However, the increase in leisure time can lead to a higher standard of living for many individuals who value their leisure more than the goods and services they could produce. Thus, relying solely on changes in real GDP to measure standard of living is inadequate.\nThis difference suggests that U.S. GDP per person is biased higher than GDP per person in African countries, as the same service—childcare—produced in both regions is included in GDP in the U.S. due to market transactions, while in Africa it is omitted due to being performed as household production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.5 What counts as GDP?\nBy how much does GDP rise in each of the following scenarios? Explain.\n\nYou spend 8000 € on college tuition this semester.\nYou buy a used computer from a friend for 500€.\nThe government spends 300€ million to build a bridge.\nForeign graduate students work as teaching assistants at the local university and earn 2000€ each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP rises by the $4,000 amount of your tuition payment. This is a purchase of a service (education) produced this semester.\nThe purchase of used goods does not involve new production. This is simply a transfer of an existing good, so GDP is unchanged. If you bought the used car from a dealer, the service of selling the car would represent new production, so something like $200 of the $2,500 might be included in GDP.\nThe new dam represents new production, and the government spending of $100 million is counted as GDP. If the spending were spread over several years, the flow of new production (and GDP) would also occur over time.\nForeign graduate students working in the United States contribute to production that occurs within the country, and this is included in GDP. So GDP increases by $5,000 for each student.",

We will begin by defining inflation and explaining how it can be measured. Then, we’ll address the challenges associated with measuring inflation and discuss why it is a potential threat to economic prosperity.\nPrices can change over time. They can rise, fall or remain stable. Inflation refers specifically to a situation in which the price level is rising, while deflation describes a fall in prices. The inflation rate quantifies this change by indicating the percentage difference in the prices from one period to the next. But what is meant when we speak about the “prices” or the “price level”?\nTo accurately calculate the price level and the real GDP of a country that includes multiple goods, respectively, it is essential to determine the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI measures the average prices paid by consumers for a fixed basket of consumer goods and services, providing insight into the overall price level in the economy.\nTypically, the CPI is normalized to equal 100 in a reference base period. For example, if the reference base period is set between 1982 and 1984, with an average CPI of 100, then an observed CPI of 269.2 in May 2021 indicates a substantial price increase of 169.2 percent since that period.",

National statistics agencies establish a market basket of goods and services commonly purchased by consumers and conduct regular surveys to determine the weights for these prices. For a visual representation of the various goods commonly purchased by typical consumers in Germany, you can refer to the informative Price Kaleidoscope as shown in Figure 6.1. For a discussion on the challenges to define a basket, see Section 6.1.2.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Price kaleidoskop\n\n\n\nSource: Destatis (2025) \nDestatis. (2025). Price kaleidoscope. Statistisches Bundesamt. https://service.destatis.de/Voronoi/PriceKaleidoscope.svg\n\n\n\n\n\nFind prices: Gather data on the prices of each good and service in the basket for each designated time period.\nCompute basket’s cost: Use the price data to calculate the total cost of the basket of goods and services at various times.\nChoose a base year and compute:\n\nDesignate one year as the base year, serving as the benchmark for comparison.\nCompute the index by dividing the basket’s price in one year by the basket’s price in the base year, then multiplying by 100.\n\\[CPI=\\frac{\\textnormal{cost of basket in current year}}{\\textnormal{cost of basket in base year}}\\cdot 100\\]\n\nCompute the inflation rate: The inflation rate is the percentage change in the price index from the previous period. It is determined by the percentage change of the CPI from one year to the next. The formula is given by \\[\nh_t = \\left(\\frac{CPI_t - CPI_{t-1}}{CPI_{t-1}} \\cdot 100\\right),\n\\] where \\(h_t\\) denotes the inflation rate at time \\(t\\) (this year), while \\(CPI_t\\) and \\(CPI_{t-1}\\) represent the CPI for time \\(t\\) and \\(t-1\\) (previous year), respectively.\nFor example, in May 2021, the CPI was 261.0, and in May 2020, it was 257.9. Using the formula, we find that the inflation rate between 2021 and 2020 was 1.2%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: CPI calculation\n\n\n\nStep 1: Consider a basket containing 4 salads and 2 hamburgers.\nStep 2: Table 6.1 shows the prices of salads and hamburgers over several years:\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Prices and quantities over time\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nPrice of salads\nPrice of hamburgers\n\n\n\n\n2016\n1\n2\n\n\n2017\n2\n3\n\n\n2018\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: The total basket cost for each year are shown in Table 6.2:\n\n\n\nTable 6.2: Basket costs over time\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nBasket cost\n\n\n\n\n2016\n8\n\n\n2017\n14\n\n\n2018\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps 4 and 5: Using 2016 as the base year, we can calculate the CPI and inflation rate as shown in Table 6.3:\n\n\n\nTable 6.3: Inflation over time\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nCPI\nInflation Rate\n\n\n\n\n2016\n100\nna\n\n\n2017\n175\n75%\n\n\n2018\n250\n43%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Challenges of the CPI\nWhile the CPI accurately reflects the prices of selected goods that comprise the typical basket, it is not a flawless measure of the cost of living. Several key issues can lead the CPI to overstate the true cost of living when the basket is held fixed over time including the following:\nSubstitution bias: Substitution bias occurs when the basket used to calculate the CPI does not adjust to reflect consumer responses to changes in relative prices. Consumers tend to substitute goods that have become relatively less expensive, which can lead the index to overstate the increase in the cost of living by not accounting for these substitution patterns.\nIntroduction of new goods: The introduction of new goods further complicates the CPI measurement, as the basket does not incorporate the changes in purchasing power that result from new products entering the market. With the addition of new goods, consumers experience a greater variety of options, which makes each euro more valuable. Consequently, consumers require less money to maintain a given standard of living as new products are introduced.\nUnmeasured quality changes: Unmeasured quality changes also pose a challenge for accurately capturing the cost of living. If the quality of a good improves from one year to the next, the real value of a euro increases, even if the price of the good remains the same. Conversely, if the quality of a good declines, the value of a euro falls, regardless of whether its price remains constant. Although the Office for National Statistics (ONS) attempts to adjust prices for constant quality, accurately measuring these quality changes can be quite difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.1 Relative weights\nExamine the weighting schemes employed by the Federal Statistics Office of Germany (Destatis) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to see how they prioritize housing and energy in their consumer price indices. For reference, here are the links to the relevant data:\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2025): Relative Importance and Weight Information for the Consumer Price Indexes\nDestatis (2019): Weighting Scheme (2015)",

    "section": "6.2 High inflation and deflation",
    "text": "6.2 High inflation and deflation\nUnexpected fluctuations in inflation or deflation pose considerable challenges for society as they lead to a redistribution of income and wealth. For example, unexpected inflation usually benefits employees and borrowers, as their income can increase, reducing the real burden of their debt. Conversely, unexpected deflation usually favours employers and lenders as the value of money increases, making it more difficult for borrowers to meet their obligations.\nThese unexpected changes can force individuals and businesses to shift their focus from productive activities to predicting and protecting against economic volatility. In particular, unexpected deflation can cause indebted businesses and households to cut back on spending, which can ultimately lead to recession and higher unemployment rates.\nIn extreme cases, hyperinflation occurs, that is usually the how inflation rates of more than 50 per cent per month are called. This can seriously destabilise an economy. Thus, central banks and politicians seek to maintain low and stable inflation due to its various negative implications for the economy. Here is an summary of the most important implications:\nMenu costs: High inflation forces businesses to frequently change their prices, resulting in lost time and increased costs.\nPurchasing power loss: Inflation impacts individuals unevenly, with low-wage earners and those on fixed nominal incomes experiencing a loss of purchasing power.\nRedistribution of wealth and income: As discussed in the section on real and nominal interest rates, rising inflation leads to decreasing real interest rates. Consequently, borrowers benefit from lower real interest payments, while lenders receive reduced real returns. This wealth redistribution occurs because debt is usually expressed in nominal terms, and inflation diminishes the actual value of fixed monetary sums.\nDistorted price signals: Inflation disrupts the clarity of prices as indicators for resource allocation. Typically, prices provide critical information regarding supply and demand, aiding informed decision-making. Inflation blurs these signals, complicating the ability to differentiate between actual changes in value and overall price increases, thereby undermining the price mechanism that guides markets.\nUncertainties: High and volatile inflation creates uncertainty surrounding future prices. This uncertainty can prevent businesses and consumers from accurately assessing the real value of money, hampering long-term planning, saving, and investment, which can ultimately lead to economic instability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.2 Global inflation\n\nInvestigate the inflation rates of selected countries online to grasp international differences and global trends. Tip: OECD Inflation Data\nDiscuss Figure 6.3.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Inflation levels and volatility in high- and low-income economies\n\n\n\nSource: CORE Econ (2025b, ch. 4.1) \n\n\n\n\nDiscuss the two time series shown in Figure 6.3.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: UK GDP growth and real oil prices (1950–2020)\n\n\n\nSource: CORE Econ (2025a, ch. 15.7) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.3 Salary over time\nIn 1947, teachers earned 1,000. By 2015, their salary had increased to 74,000, which means that nominally, they earned 74 times as much in 2015 as they did in 1947. However, to determine whether teachers can buy more or less today compared to 1947, we need to consider the impact of rising prices over time. Given the CPI values of \\(CPI_{t=1947} = 28.9\\) and \\(CPI_{t=2015} = 1018.6\\) calculate the real difference in purchasing power from 1947 to 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo convert teachers’ salaries from 1947 to 2015 values, we can use the following formula:\n\\[\n\\text{salary}_{2015}^{\\text{real}} = \\text{salary}_{1947} \\cdot \\frac{CPI_{2015}}{CPI_{1947}} = \\text{€}1,000 \\cdot \\frac{1018.6}{28.9} = \\text{€}35,246\n\\]\nThis calculation shows that 1,000 in 1947 had the same purchasing power as 35,246 in 2015. Since teachers earned 74,000 in 2015, they can indeed buy more with their salary than they could in 1947.",

(2022, ch. 19)\nLearning objectives:\nStudents will be able to:\nIn economics, understanding the distinction between real and nominal values is crucial for analyzing wage levels and currency measurements. Nominal wages refer to the monetary amount received by workers, unadjusted for inflation. For example, if a worker is paid €50,000 per year, that figure represents their nominal wage. However, nominal wages do not account for changes in purchasing power over time due to inflation.\nReal wages, on the other hand, provide a more accurate reflection of a worker’s purchasing power by adjusting nominal wages for changes in prices. To compute real wages, economists typically use the CPI. For example, in case of inflation, the real wage controls for the worker can actually afford fewer goods and services than before.\nSimilarly, this distinction extends to other economic metrics, such as gross domestic product (GDP). Real GDP is adjusted for inflation, providing a clearer picture of an economy’s growth by reflecting the true value of goods and services produced over time. In contrast, nominal GDP represents the raw monetary value without an inflation adjustment.",

    "text": "7.2 Welfare comparisons\nTo compare living standards across countries using real GDP, we face several challenges as discussed in greater detail in Shapiro et al. (2022, ch. 19). Let me emphasize two things:\n\nShapiro, D., MacDonald, D., & Greenlaw, S. A. (2022). Principles of economics (3rd ed.). OpenStax. https://openstax.org/details/books/principles-economics-3e\nFirst, the real GDP of one country must be converted into the same currency unit as the real GDP of another country. This process is straightforward once we have the exchange rates; however, these rates often fluctuate significantly, which can lead to misleading interpretations of GDP when assessed during periods of exchange rate peaks. Additionally, if the prices of goods and services vary considerably between countries, differences in GDP may not solely reflect disparities in living standards.\nSecond, it is essential that the goods and services in both countries are valued at the same prices. Relative prices can differ across countries, so goods and services should be weighted appropriately. For instance, if prices are generally lower in China than in the United States, this would undervalue China’s production when using its domestic prices. Therefore, if we value all goods and services produced in China using U.S. prices, we can achieve a more accurate comparison of real GDP between the two countries. This comparison, made using consistent pricing, is referred to as purchasing power parity (PPP) prices. The PPP principle is based on the idea that, in the absence of transportation costs and other barriers, identical goods should have the same price when expressed in a common currency.\nTo calculate PPP-adjusted GDP for a more accurate cross-country comparison, the following steps are typically taken:\n\nSelect a representative basket of goods and services for each country.\nDetermine the respective prices that apply to all countries.\nCalculate the exchange rate based on the selected baskets and prices. This rate is known as the PPP exchange rate and reflects the relative price levels between the two countries.\nConvert the real GDP of each country into a common currency using the PPP exchange rate.\n\nThe resulting adjusted GDP values allow for a more accurate comparison of living standards and play a significant role in international economic analysis and policy formulation.\nIt is important to note that while the concept of PPP is useful, it is a simplification that does not fully capture the complexities of international trade, market imperfections, and non-tradable goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Germany and Indonesia\n\n\n\nLet us compare the GDP in PPP for two countries, Germany and Indonesia, using a simplified scenario that assumes a basket of only two goods: bread and milk. Prices are given in local currencies, i.e., Euros for Germany and Rupiah for Indonesia. For this example, let’s say one bread in Germany costs €2 and a liter of milk costs €1.5. In Indonesia, one bread costs 12,000 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and a liter of milk costs 10,000 IDR.\nStep 1: Basket of goods and services\n\nBread price in Germany: €2\n\nMilk price in Germany: €1.5\n\nBread price in Indonesia: 12,000 IDR\n\nMilk price in Indonesia: 10,000 IDR\n\nStep 2: Price comparison\n\nBread price ratio: €2 / 12,000 IDR = 0.00016667\n\nMilk price ratio: €1.5 / 10,000 IDR = 0.00015\n\nStep 3: Exchange rate calculation\n\nAverage price ratio: (0.00016667 + 0.00015) / 2 = 0.000158335\n\nPPP exchange rate: 1 Euro = 0.000158335 IDR\n\nNow, using the PPP exchange rate, we can convert GDP figures between the two countries to facilitate a more accurate comparison of their economies.\nPlease note that this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes. Actual PPP calculations involve more comprehensive baskets of goods, data collection, adjustments for non-traded goods, and more sophisticated methods. Real-world PPP calculations are conducted by organizations such as the International Comparison Program (ICP) to provide accurate comparisons of living standards across countries.",

    "text": "7.3 Alternative measures of welfare\nDespite its weaknesses the GDP is one of the best measures we have to indicate living standards. Please watch the video of Figure 7.1. However, we should try to also look out for other measures that can complement the GDP.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Real GDP per capita and the standard of living\n\n\n\nSource: Youtube\n\n\n\nDisposable income:\nDisposable income is defined as total income minus taxes plus government transfers. It represents the income that households and non-corporate businesses have available after fulfilling their obligations to the government. While GDP includes the value of goods and services produced by the government, such as education, national defense, and law enforcement—factors that contribute to well-being—these are not reflected in disposable income. Thus, GDP per capita can serve as a better measure of living standards than disposable income itself.\nGross National Product (GNP):\nThe GNP refers to the total income earned by a nation’s citizens, whether generated domestically or abroad. This measure captures the economic contributions of citizens, regardless of location.\nNet National Product (NNP)\nThe NNP is calculated as the total income of a nation’s residents (GNP) minus losses due to depreciation. Depreciation accounts for the decline in value of the economy’s stock of equipment and structures, such as aging vehicles and obsolete computers.\nWorld Happiness Report:\nThe World Happiness Report primarily utilizes data from the Gallup World Poll, which surveys individuals in over 150 countries (see: World Happiness Report). Each variable measured reflects a population-weighted average score on a scale from 0 to 10 that is tracked over time and compared against other countries. Current variables in the report include:\n\nReal GDP per capita\nSocial support\nHealthy life expectancy\nFreedom to make life choices\nGenerosity\nPerceptions of corruption\n\nHuman Development Index (HDI)\nThe HDI is a composite index that incorporates life expectancy, education (mean years of schooling completed and expected years of schooling), and per capita income indicators. Countries are ranked into four tiers of human development based on these metrics. A country attains a higher HDI when it achieves greater longevity, higher education levels, and a higher gross national income (GNI) per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) (see: Human Development Index).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7.2 OECD Better Life Index\nVisit the OECD Better Life Index to create your own index by weighting the factors that are important to you. Then, explore what aspects of life matter most, on average, for people in your home country.",

(2022, ch. 2, appendix A and B)\nLearning objectives:\nIn this section, I cover some basic concepts that are crucial for understanding the upcoming sections. In particular, students will be able to:\nA firm or a company is a productive unit. In particular, it is an organization that produces goods and services. In short, it can be called output. To do so, it uses inputs called factors of production, that is, labor, capital, land, skills, etc. The relationship between the inputs and the output is the production function. The goal of the firm is to achieve whatever goal its owner(s) decide to achieve through the firm. Usually, it is (and in Germany for example it has to be the case by law) to generate profits, that is, total revenue minus total cost for the level of production.\nA production function (PF) is a mathematical representation of the process that transforms inputs into output.\nThe returns to scale describes the increase in output when a firm multiples all of its inputs by some factor. Let \\(\\lambda&gt;1,\\) then, with two factors \\(\\mathrm{K}\\) and \\(L\\), we can define that for \\[\nf(c K, c L)= c^\\lambda f(K, L),\n\\]\nThe marginal product is the change in the total output when the input varies of one infinitesimal small unit. Graphically, the marginal product is the slope of the total product function at any point. The slope of the total product function, that is, the marginal product, is generally not constant. The marginal product to an input is assumed to decrease beyond some level of input. This is called the law of diminishing marginal returns. In particular, we can distinguish:",

    "text": "8.2 Production possibility frontier curve\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: The production possibility frontier curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe production possibilities frontier (PPF) curve shown in Figure 8.1 provides a graphical representation of all possible production options for two products when all available resources and factors of production are fully and efficiently utilized within a given time period. The PPF serves as a boundary between combinations of goods and services that can be produced and those that cannot.\nThe PPF is an invaluable tool for illustrating the effects of scarcity as it provides insights into production efficiency, opportunity costs and the trade-offs between different choices. In general, the PPF exhibits concavity, as not all factors of production can be used equally productively in all activities.\nEconomic growth refers to the continuous expansion of production possibilities. An economy experiences growth through technological advances, improvements in the quality of labor or an increase in the factors of production (labor, capital). When the resources of an economy increase, the production possibilities also expand, shifting the PPF outwards. It is worth noting that PPF can be used to explain production in an economy or company.\nProduction efficiency occurs when it is impossible to produce more of one good or service without producing less of another. If production takes place directly on the PPF, this means efficiency. If, on the other hand, production takes place within the PPF (yellow shaded area of Figure 8.1), it is possible to produce more goods without sacrificing existing goods, which indicates inefficiency. If production is on the PPF, there is a trade-off, as obtaining more of one good requires sacrificing a certain amount of another good. This trade-off is associated with costs called opportunity costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8.1 Understanding production (Solution 8.1)\n\nFigure 8.2 shows a PPF and five conceivable production points, \\(C_i\\), where \\(i\\in \\{1,\\dots,5\\}\\). Explain the figure using the following terms: _attainable point; available resources, unattainable, inefficient, efficient point.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Production and different consumption points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would happen to the PPF if the technology available in a country and needed for the production process became better?\nWhat would happen to the PPF if the resources available in a country and needed in the production process of both goods shrank?\nWhat would happen to the PPF if the resources (technology) available in a country that are needed in the production process…\n\n…for both goods increased (improved)?\n…for good A shrank (got worse)?\n…for good B increased (improved)?\n\nDoes the shape of the PPF tell us anything about economies of scale in the production process?\nFigure 8.3 shows an extreme PPF. How can such a PPF be explained?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Extreme production possibility frontier curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 8.1. Understanding production (Exercise 8.1)\n\nAny point that lies either on the production possibilities curve or to the left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Production points that lie in the yellow shaded area are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. These points represent an inefficient production, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.\nThe PPF would shift outwards.\nThe PPF would shift inwards.\nThe PPF would shift…\n\n…outwards for both goods.\n…inwards for good A, see Figure 8.4.\n…outwards for good B.\n\nWith economies of scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the opportunity cost of one good falling as more of it is produced. A straight-line (linear) PPF reflects a situation where resources are not specialized and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. With constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if there was only one factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve.\nHere is one example: Suppose a country that is endowed with two factors of production and that one factor can only be used for producing good A and the other factor can only be used to produce good B.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Shrinking production possibilities in good A",

These curves illustrate the various bundles of goods where consumers are equally satisfied. That means all points on an indifference curve represent the same level of utility. The shape of the indifference curve is determined by the underlying utility function, which captures the preferences of consumers for consuming different combinations of the two goods.\nThe slope of an indifference curve indicates the rate at which the two goods can be substituted while maintaining the same level of utility for the consumer. Technically, the slope represents the marginal rate of substitution, which is equal to the absolute value of the slope. It measures the maximum quantity of one good that a consumer is willing to give up in order to obtain an additional unit of the other good.\nIt is assumed that consumers aim to attain the highest possible indifference curve because a higher curve, located further to the right on a coordinate system, represents a higher level of utility. In Figure 8.6, for example, \\((IC_1)\\) represents a lower level of utility than \\((IC_2)\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: Indifference curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the concept of indifference curves, an isoquant shows the combinations of factors of production that result in the same quantity of output.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: Perfect complements or substitutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8.2 Isoquants\n\nWhich of the two plots of Figure 8.7 show isoquants when factors of production are perfect complements and perfect substitutes, respectively?\nDiscuss the features of a Cobb-Douglas PF with respect to returns to scale and marginal product of production for both inputs.

A market might be a physical place or a group of buyers and sellers spread around the world who never meet. In this chapter, we study a competitive market that has so many buyers and sellers that no individual buyer or seller can influence the price. Quantity demanded is the amount of a good, service, or resource that people are willing and able to buy during a specified period at a specified price. The quantity demanded is expressed as an amount per unit of time, for example, the amount per day or per month. Supply and demand are the forces that make market economies work because they determine prices in a market economy. Prices, in turn, allocate the economy’s scarce resources. The model of the market based on supply and demand, like any other model, is based on a series of assumptions.",

Yet you can get water in your apartment in New York without paying for it. On modern Roman streets you can wash your hands or bathe your dog at any old fire hydrant. In the office and in the dorm you can drink water from the fountain down the hall.\nDiamonds are different. You can live without diamonds. Yet they are very expensive, valued extremely highly per ounce in the marketplace.\nNotice how strange this is - how a good such as a diamond, which is beautiful but inessential, could be so much more expensive per ounce than an essential and not necessarily beautiful good, such as water. The case is called ‘the water/diamond paradox.’ It is the first and the deepest question of value. What, after all, determines the value of things?” (Klamer et al., 2015, ch. 5.1)\n\nDiscuss the water-diamond paradox. Can you think of similar examples of goods that have a high price but no real value? Also discuss what the value of a good is when it is not based on price.\n\n\n\n\n\nKlamer, A., McCloskey, D., & Ziliak, S. (2015). The economic conversation. https://www.theeconomicconversation.com",

Conversely, if the price of the good falls, the quantity demanded of that good increases.\n\n\n9.2.2 Demand schedule and demand curve\nDemand is the relationship between the quantity demanded and the price of a good when all other influences on buying plans remain the same. Demand is illustrated by a demand schedule and a demand curve. The demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded. In Table 9.1 you see an example of a demand schedule for two individuals, A and B. This schedule is visualized in Figure 9.1.\nMarket demand refers to the sum of all individual demands for a particular good or service.

For example, if the price of a specific good changes, the quantity demanded will typically be altered by two effects: the income effect and the substitution effect:\n\nThe income effect: Assuming that consumers’ incomes remain constant, a decrease in the price of a good allows them to purchase more of it with their available income.\nThe substitution effect: If the price of one good is lower compared to other similar products, some consumers will choose to substitute the more expensive options with the now cheaper alternative, such as milk.\n\nIn section ?sec-consumption, I will discuss both the income and substitution effects in greater detail.\nIn contrast, changes in other factors that influence demand can result in a shift of the demand curve in a price-quantity diagram. A shift in the demand curve—either to the left or right—occurs when there is a change that affects the quantity demanded at every price level. Below is an incomplete list of factors that can cause demand curves to shift:\nIncome: The overall income of consumers greatly impacts their purchasing power. For normal goods, as income rises, the demand increases. Conversely, for inferior goods, demand decreases as income increases. For example, when consumers have higher incomes, they are less likely to purchase instant noodles (an inferior good) and may instead buy higher-quality meals.\nTastes and preferences: Changes in consumer preferences can shift demand. If health trends favor plant-based foods, demand for these products may rise, while demand for red meat may decline.\nConsumer expectations: Expectations about future prices can influence current demand. If consumers expect that prices will rise in the future, they are more likely to purchase now, increasing current demand. Conversely, if they expect prices to drop, they may delay purchases, decreasing current demand.\nPopulation and demographics: Changes in the number of consumers or their demographics can impact demand. For example, an aging population might increase the demand for healthcare products and services, while a growing youth demographic might boost demand for technology and entertainment products.\nPrice of related goods: When the price of a good rises, consumers may switch to other goods that offer similar benefits, known as substitutes. A substitute is a product that can be consumed in place of another. For example, apples and oranges are substitutes. If the price of butter increases, consumers may opt for margarine instead. In this scenario, the demand for margarine increases, while the demand for butter decreases. Conversely, demand can also be affected by changes in the prices of complementary goods—products that are often consumed together. A complement is a good that pairs well with another. For instance, sausages and mustard, or fish and chips are common complements. If the price of printers drops, the demand for ink cartridges might increase as more people purchase printers. Or, if the price of hot dogs rises, the demand for hot dog buns may decrease.",

    "text": "9.3 Types of goods\nGoods can be classified based on how their demand reacts to changes in prices and consumer income. Here are some relevant types of goods:\n\n9.3.1 Normal goods\nA normal good is defined as a good for which the demand increases as income increases. Conversely, demand decreases when income decreases.\nExamples of normal goods include luxury items, branded clothing, and high-quality food products. As consumers’ incomes rise, they are more likely to purchase these goods, reflecting their preference for higher-quality or more luxurious items.\n\n\n9.3.2 Inferior goods\nAn inferior good is one for which the demand decreases as incomes rise and increases when incomes fall.\nExamples of inferior goods include budget brands, instant noodles, and second-hand clothing. When consumers have lower incomes, they may opt for these less expensive options, but as their income increases, they tend to switch to more expensive alternatives.\n\n\n9.3.3 Giffen goods:\nA giffen good is a special type of good that increase in demand when its price rises, violating the basic law of demand. This phenomenon typically occurs because the good is so essential that the consumer constitutes a significant portion of its budget and they buy even more if it when the price increases as their inability to afford more expensive alternatives.\n\n\n9.3.4 Veblen goods:\nA Veblen good is a type of luxury good for which demand increases as the price increases, contrary to the law of demand. These goods serve as a status symbol. The higher price makes them more desirable to certain consumers who view these goods as markers of wealth or prestige. Examples include designer handbags and high-end cars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRead the two Wikipedia entries for giffen and veblen goods: Wikipedia (2025a) and Wikipedia (2025b).\n\n\n\nWikipedia.

In Table 9.2 an example of a supply schedule is shown that illustrates the relationship between the price of a good and the corresponding quantity supplied. The graphical representation of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied is visualized in Figure 9.4.\n\n\n\nTable 9.2: Example: supply schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice of good per unit (€)\nproducer A\n+\nproducer B\n=\nMarket\n\n\n\n\n0.00\n0\n+\n0\n=\n0\n\n\n0.10\n0\n+\n1\n=\n1\n\n\n0.20\n2\n+\n2\n=\n4\n\n\n0.30\n4\n+\n3\n=\n7\n\n\n0.40\n6\n+\n4\n=\n10\n\n\n0.50\n8\n+\n5\n=\n13\n\n\n0.60\n10\n+\n6\n=\n16\n\n\n0.70\n12\n+\n7\n=\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Supply curves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.1 Changes and shifts of supply\nThe supply curve illustrates the quantities that producers are willing to offer for sale at various prices, while assuming that all other factors affecting their selling decisions remain constant. Any alteration in these additional factors—excluding price changes—results in a shift of the supply curve either to the left or the right.\nSeveral key factors can cause shifts in the supply curve. These include the profitability of alternative goods in production and the prices of goods produced jointly. Advancements in technology can also influence supply, as can changes in the number of sellers in the market. Natural and social factors, such as weather conditions and evolving public attitudes, play a significant role as well. Furthermore, input prices—the costs associated with the factors of production—affect the supply. As production costs rise, the quantity supplied typically decreases. Expectations regarding future market conditions can also impact supply decisions, as can changes in resource prices. Higher resource and input prices generally elevate production costs, resulting in a reduced quantity supplied. Additionally, improvements in productivity—defined as output per unit of input—can lower costs and lead to an increase in supply.\nA change in the price of one good can impact the supply of another good. This relationship occurs particularly in the context of goods that can be produced in place of one another, known as substitutes in production. These are goods that can be manufactured using similar resources, allowing producers to switch between them based on price fluctuations and market demands.\nOverall, these dynamics illustrate the complex interplay of various factors that can influence how supply responds to changes in the market environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9.4 Prices of related goods in production\nFill in the blanks:\n\nThe quantity supplied of a good ______________ (increases/decreases) if the price of one of its substitutes in production falls.\n\nThe quantity supplied of a good ______________ (increases/decreases) if the price of one of its substitutes in production rises.\n\nThe quantity supplied of a good ______________ (increases/decreases) if the price of one of its complements in production rises.\n\nThe quantity supplied of a good ______________ (increases/decreases) if the price of one of its complements in production falls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecreases\nincreases\ndecreases\nincreases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.2 Market equilibrium\nIn economics, equilibrium refers to a situation where economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced. In the absence of external influences, the equilibrium values of economic variables remain unchanged.\nThe price that balances quantity supplied and quantity demanded is called the equilibrium price. Graphically, this is the price at which the supply and demand curves intersect. The quantity that comes along the equilibrium price is called the equilibrium quantity. That is visualized in Figure 9.5.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Market equilibrium of supply and demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9.5 After the visual determination of the equilibrium market price and quantity, calculate the equilibrium market price and quantity assuming the demand function:\n\\[x(p) = -\\frac{3}{4}p + 300\\]\nand the supply function\n\\[x_S(p) = \\frac{5}{4}p - 100.\\]\nAddtionally, draw the two functions and mark the equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo formally calculate the equilibrium market price and quantity using the given demand and supply functions, you can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for the price (p). Here’s how it can be represented mathematically:\nAt equilibrium, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied: \\[x(p) = x_S(p)\\] Soving both functions for \\(x\\) and setting the two functions equal gives: \\[-\\frac{3}{4}p + 300 = \\frac{5}{4}p - 100\\] Now, solve for (p): \\[p = 200.\\] Substituting \\(p = 200\\) back into either the demand or supply equation yields \\[x(200) = -\\frac{3}{4}(200) + 300, \\] or\n\\[x(200) = -150 + 300.\\] Thus, the equilibrium quantity is \\[x^* = 150\\] and the equilibrium market price is \\[p^* = 200\\]\nThe graphical solution is shown in Figure 9.6.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: The equlibrium with supply and demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply &gt; demand (surplus / excess)\nIf price &gt; equilibrium price, then quantity supplied &gt; quantity demanded. There is excess supply or a surplus. Suppliers will lower the price to increase sales, thereby moving towards equilibrium.\nSupply &lt; demand (shortage)\nIf price &lt; equilibrium price, then quantity demanded &gt; quantity supplied. There is excess demand or a shortage. Suppliers will raise the price due to too many buyers chasing too few goods, thereby moving toward equilibrium.\nThree steps to analyzing changes in equilibrium\n\nDecide whether the event shifts the supply or demand curve (or both).\nDetermine whether the curve(s) shift to the left or to the right.\nUse the supply and demand diagram to see how the shift affects equilibrium price and quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9.6 Supply and demand for coffee\nSuppose you are observing the market for coffee.

More specifically, it is the interaction of demand and supply in markets that generates prices that serve to allocate items to their highest valued alternatives. Consumers will pay higher prices for goods and services that they value more highly. Producers will devote more resources to the production of goods and services that have higher prices, all else being equal. Similarly, workers will provide more hours of labor to jobs that pay higher salaries.\nThis allocation principle applies to all free and well functioning markets such as product markets for items such as cars, houses, and haircuts, as well as to resource markets for items such as labor, land, and equipment. Factors that interfere with the workings of a competitive market result in an inefficient allocation of resources, leading to a reduction in society’s overall well-being.",

[…] It was the magic of the price system—the impersonal operation of prices that brought them together and got them to cooperate to make this pencil so that you could have it for a trifling sum.\n\nAlso, recall Adam Smith, who wrote in perhaps the most influential book in economics, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (Smith, 1776), that the pursuit of self-interest in a marketplace would promote the general interest.

Now, we explore whether the equilibrium achieved in the market is truly optimal for both consumers and suppliers. Consumer surplus and producer surplus are helpful concepts in economics for welfare analysis. They help us understand the benefits that consumers and producers gain from participating in a market exchange.\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Consumer and producer surplus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Anon (2020, ch. 6.2)\nAnon. (2020). Principles of economics (2nd ed.). saylor.rog. https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_principles-of-economics-v2.0/index.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer surplus refers to the additional value that consumers receive beyond what they actually pay for a product or service in the market. It is essentially the difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a good or service (their willingness to pay) and the actual price they pay.\nOn the other side, producer surplus pertains to the benefit that producers receive from market transactions. It’s the difference between the price at which producers are willing to supply a good or service and the actual price they receive. This surplus highlights the additional revenue that producers gain beyond what they need to cover their production costs.\nBoth consumer surplus and producer surplus contribute to the overall economic welfare in a market. Maximizing both surpluses ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, benefiting both sides of the exchange and contributing to societal well-being. The equilibrium point where these surpluses are maximized is the point where the demand and supply curves intersect. Figure 10.3 visualizes the explained concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10.2 Welfare and taxes\n\nThe following diagram shows the supply and demand schedule for a given good in a closed economy, where $P^* = 6 , $ denotes the equilibrium market price and $ Q^* = 5000 $ denotes the equilibrium quantity traded in the market.

    "text": "11.1 Budget constraint\nSubjects such as consumers and producers often face decisions with specific goals while dealing with various constraints. This process is referred to as decision-making and optimization under constraints. Specifically, we encounter problems related to maximization or minimization within these constraints.\nFor example, consumers may have a fixed budget to allocate among various items, or consumers have identified a specific basket of items they wish to purchase and now they seek to minimize the costs for that basket. The first is represents a maximization problem and the latter a minimization problem. Similarly, producers typically aim to maximize their profits given a limited amount of production factors, or they seek to minimize costs for a certain level of production.\nThis section will explore how to approach these optimization problems rationally. We will revisit the concept of utility before discussing two mathematical techniques that can provide solutions: the Lagrangian Multiplier method and Linear Programming.\nIn microeconomics, the concept of a budget constraint plays a vital role in understanding consumer decision-making and helps to analyze consumer choices and trade-offs. The budget constraint represents the limitations faced by consumers in allocating their limited income across different goods and services. The budget constraint indicates that the total expenditure on goods and services, calculated by multiplying the prices of each item by its corresponding quantity, must be less than or equal to the consumer’s income. Mathematically, the budget constraint can be expressed as: \\[\nP_1 \\cdot Q_1 + P_2 \\cdot Q_2 + \\ldots + P_n \\cdot Q_n \\leq I\n\\] where (\\(P_n\\)) represent the prices of goods, (\\(Q_n\\)) denote the quantities of goods (\\(n\\)) consumed. (\\(I\\)) denotes the consumer’s income or their budget.\nConsumers strive to maximize their utility by selecting the optimal combination of goods and services within the constraints imposed by their limited income. This involves making decisions about how much of each good to consume while staying within the budgetary limits. The graphical representation of the ideal consumption point is depicted in Figure Figure 11.1.\nBy studying the budget constraint, economists can gain insights into consumer behavior, price changes, and the impact of income fluctuations on consumption patterns.",

    "section": "11.2 Consumption and production choices",
    "text": "11.2 Consumption and production choices\n\n11.2.1 Decision making at the margin\nTo understand how households and individuals, respectively, make choices, economists examine what consumers can afford, illustrated by a budget constraint line, along with the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices. In a budget constraint, the quantity of one good is represented on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good on the vertical axis. The budget constraint line illustrates various combinations of two goods that are affordable based on consumer income.\nTo introduce the basic concept of how consumers make decisions, consider a situation where a consumer\n\ncan buy two different products, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nGood \\(y\\) costs €14 per unit, while\ngood \\(x\\) costs €7 per unit.\nEach unit of consumption comes with a certain level of pleasure, or utility.\nSuppose the consumer’s budget is €56 and\nthe utilities are specified in Table 11.1, with the possible points of consumption visualized in Figure 11.2. The points on the budget constraint line indicate the combinations of goods that the consumer can afford.\n\nThe consumer aims to choose the combination that maximizes utility, which economists use to describe an individual’s level of satisfaction or happiness with their decisions. In this scenario, five different options are possible, assuming that fractions of goods cannot be consumed. Thus, we simply calculate the overall utility for each option and select the highest value. It is important to note that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed, meaning that each subsequent unit of a good provides less additional utility. This phenomenon exemplifies the law of diminishing marginal utility, which states that additional utility decreases with each unit consumed.\n\n\n\nTable 11.1: Marginal utility and consumers’ decision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\) (Quantity)\nTotal Utility\nMarginal Utility\nMarginal Utility per Dollar\nGood \\(x\\) (Quantity)\nTotal Utility\nMarginal Utility\nMarginal Utility per Dollar\n\n\n\n\n1\n22\n22\n1.57\n1\n16\n16\n2.29\n\n\n2\n43\n21\n1.50\n2\n31\n15\n2.14\n\n\n3\n63\n20\n1.43\n3\n45\n14\n2.00\n\n\n4\n81\n18\n1.29\n4\n58\n13\n1.86\n\n\n5\n97\n16\n1.14\n5\n70\n12\n1.71\n\n\n6\n111\n14\n1.00\n6\n81\n11\n1.57\n\n\n7\n123\n12\n0.86\n7\n91\n10\n1.43\n\n\n8\n133\n10\n0.71\n8\n100\n9\n1.29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Total utility and diminishing marginal utility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother perspective is to focus on utility per Euro. In this context, marginal utility per Euro quantifies the additional utility a consumer receives relative to the price of the product.\n\\[ \\text{Marginal Utility per Euro} = \\frac{\\text{Marginal Utility}}{\\text{Price}} \\]\nThe general equation for marginal utility is:\n\\[ \\text{Marginal Utility} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Total Utility}}{\\text{Change in Quantity}} \\]\nThe consumer’s first purchase will be a unit of good \\(x\\) because it offers the highest marginal utility per Euro and is within his budget. He will continue purchasing units of good \\(x\\) until the utility gained from the sixth unit of good \\(x\\) is equal to that of one unit of good \\(y\\)f.\nThis method for determining the optimal choice can be summarized by a general rule: the utility-maximizing choice between consumption goods occurs where the marginal utility per Euro (“Bang for the Buck”) is equal for both goods:\n\\[ \\text{Marginal Utility per Euro of Good 1} = \\text{Marginal Utility per Euro of Good 2} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{22}{14} = \\frac{11}{7} \\]\n\\[ 1.57 = 1.57 \\]\n\n\n11.2.2 Utility maximization\nIn microeconomics, utility maximization (in its simplest form when having just two goods) involves selecting a combination of two goods that satisfies two essential conditions, see Figure 11.3:\n\nThe chosen point of utility maximization must fall within the attainable region defined by the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) or be affordable within the constraints of a given budget.\nThe selected point of utility maximization must lie on the highest indifference curve that is consistent with the first condition.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Optimal consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese conditions ensure that the consumer selects the optimal bundle of goods that maximizes their utility while taking into account the constraints imposed by production capabilities or budget limitations.\nBy analyzing production possibilities and individual preferences, economists gain insights into how consumers make choices, allocate resources, and achieve utility maximization. Understanding these concepts helps economists explore the trade-offs and decision-making processes that influence consumer behavior and shape market dynamics.\nIf you are not familiar with the basic principles of the production possibility frontier curve, indifference curves, and budget constraints, I recommend referring to Chapter 8 for a comprehensive overview. This section provides a detailed explanation and exploration of these concepts.\n\n\n11.2.3 The role of income and budget\nIf income increases the budget constraint curve shifts outwards (to the right) as shown in Figure 11.4.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Impact of income change on consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe utility-maximizing choice on the original budget constraint is M. The dashed horizontal and vertical lines extending through point M allow you to see at a glance whether the quantity consumed of goods on the new budget constraint is higher or lower than on the original budget constraint. On the new budget constraint, a choice like N will be made if both goods are normal goods. If good \\(x\\) is an inferior good, a choice like P will be made. If good \\(y\\) is an inferior good, a choice like Q will be made.\n\n\n11.2.4 The role of prices\nIf price of one good increases then the budget constraint curve. When the price rises, the budget constraint shifts in to the left for that good.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Impact of price change on consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dashed lines make it possible to see at a glance whether the new consumption choice involves less of both goods, or less of one good and more of the other. The new possible choices would be good \\(x\\)’s and more good \\(y\\)’s, like point H, or less of both goods, as at point J. Choice K would mean that the higher price of good \\(x\\) led to exactly the same quantity of good \\(x\\) being consumed, but fewer of good \\(y\\). Choices like L are theoretically possible (if good \\(x\\) are giffen goods) but highly unlikely in the real world, because they would mean that a higher price for goods \\(x\\) means a greater quantity consumed of good \\(x\\).\n\n\n11.2.5 Substitution and income effect\nWhen prices increase, individuals typically respond by reducing their consumption of the product with the higher price. This reaction is driven by two factors, both of which can occur simultaneously.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Impact of income change on consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe substitution effect occurs when a price change incentivizes consumers to consume less of a good with a relatively higher price and more of a good with a relatively lower price.\nThe income effect stems from the fact that a higher price effectively reduces the purchasing power of income (even if actual income remains the same). This reduction in purchasing power leads to a decrease in the consumption of the good, particularly when the good is considered normal.\nFigure 11.6 illustrates the Hicksian decomposition for a price reduction of good \\(A\\), which affects the consumption of goods \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), shifting the consumption point from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\). The point \\(C'\\) represents the hypothetical consumption point resulting from a rotated budget constraint that reflects the new price relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11.1 The graphical foundations of demand curves\nA shift in the budget constraint means that when individuals are seeking their highest utility, the quantity that is demanded of that good will change. In this way, the logical foundations of demand curves—which show a connection between prices and quantity demanded—are based on the underlying idea of individuals seeking utility.\nIn Figure 11.7, two points of consumption are displayed, illustrating the optimal choices made by customers when faced with prices \\(p_x^1&gt;p_x^2\\). The objective of this exercise is to graphically derive the demand function for good \\(x\\). To accomplish this, please provide a second two-dimensional plot below the existing graph, with the price of good \\(x\\), \\(p_x\\), represented on the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: Graphical derivation of the demand function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.6 Consumption, production, and terms of trade\nMarket prices in a closed economy: The price relation of two goods, the so-called terms of trade, is determined by the slope of the Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) at the point where it is tangent to the indifference curve. This relationship highlights the trade-off between the two goods and their relative scarcity within a closed economy.\nUtility maximizing production: The production point that maximizes utility is where the PPF is tangent to the price relation, that is, the terms of trade. This principle applies not only in a closed economy (autarky) but also under free trade (open economy). It implies that producers should allocate resources in a way that balances the trade-off between producing more of one good at the expense of another, while considering consumer preferences. Figure 11.3 depicts this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11.2 Understanding indifference curves and budget constraints\n\nWhich indifference curve in Figure 11.8 represents the highest utility level? Explain your decision.\nSuppose two goods are perfect substitutes. Two goods are substitutes if they can be used for the same purpose or provide the same utility to the consumer. Draw the indifference curves for perfect substitutes.\nSuppose two goods are perfect complements. Two goods are complements if they go well together and the demand for one good is related to the demand for another good. A perfect complement is a good that must be consumed together with another good. Draw the indifference curves for perfect complements.\nSuppose you have a fixed income \\(I=10\\) that you can spend on consuming two goods \\(x, y\\) at certain prices \\(p_x=1, p_y=1\\). Draw the budget line consisting of all possible combinations of two goods that a consumer can buy at certain market prices by allocating his income. Using indifference curves, sketch what each consumer should consume to maximize utility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IC that goes through points 1 and 2 represent the lowest utility. The IC that goes through 4 the highest.\n\nTask solved in class.\nTask solved in class.\nThe budget line can be sketched into a y-x plot by solving \\(p_xx+p_yy=I\\) for y: \\[y=\\frac{I}{p_y}-\\frac{p_x}{p_y}x\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11.3 Utility maximization\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: Utility maximization\n\n\n\nSource: Emerson (2019, ch. 4)\n\n\n\nAssign the following words to the respective points in Figure 11.8.\n\nOptimal bundle.\nCan do better by trading some B for some A.\nCan do better by trading some B for some A.\nUnaffordable.\n\nPlease find solutions to the exercise in Emerson (2019, ch. 4).\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerson, P.

    "text": "11.3 Linear programming\nLinear Programming is a common technique for decision making under certainty. It allows to express a desired benefit (such as profit) as a mathematical function of several variables. The solution is the set of values for the independent variables (decision variables) that serves to maximize the benefit or to minimize the negative outcome under consideration of certain limits, a.k.a. constraints. The method usually follows a four step procedure:\n\nstate the problem;\nstate the decision variables;\nset up an objective function;\nclarify the constraints.\n\nExample: Consider a factory producing two products, product X and product Y. The problem is this: If you can realize $10.00 profit per unit of product X and $14.00 per unit of product Y, what is the production level of x units of product X and y units of product Y that maximizes the profit P each day? Your production, and therefore your profit, is subject to resource limitations, or constraints. Assume in this example that you employ five workers—three machinists and two assemblers—and that each works only 40 hours a week.1\n1 The example is taken from Morse et al. (2014, p. 134f).\nMorse, L. C., Babcock, D. L., & Murthy, M. (2014). Managing engineering and technology (Sixth Edition). Pearson.\n\nProduct X requires three hours of machining and one hour of assembly per unit.\nProduct Y requires two hours of machining and two hours of assembly per unit.\n\n\nState the problem: How many of product X and product Y to produce to maximize profit?\nDecision variables: Suppose x denotes the number of product X to produce per day and y denotes number of product Y to produce per day\nObjective function: Maximize \\[P = 10x + 14y\\]\nConstraints:\n\n\nmachine time=120h\nassembling time=80h\nhours needed for production of one good:\n\nmachine time: \\(x\\rightarrow 3h\\) and \\(y \\rightarrow 2h\\)\nassembling time: \\(x\\rightarrow 1h\\) and \\(y \\rightarrow 2h\\)\nThus, we get: \\[3x + 2y \\leq 120 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow y\\leq 60-\\frac{3}{2}x \\quad \\text{(hours of machining time)}\\] \\[x + 2y \\leq 80 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow y \\leq 40-\\frac{1}{2}x \\quad \\text{(hours of assembly time)}\\] Since there are only two products, these limitations can be shown on a two-dimensional graph Figure 11.9. Since all relationships are linear, the solution to our problem will fall at one of the corners.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: Linear program example: Constraints and solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo draw the isoprofit function in a plot with the good \\(y\\) on the y-axis and good \\(x\\) on the x-axis, we can re-arrange the objective function to get \\[y=\\frac{1}{14}P-\\frac{10}{14}x\\] To illustrate the function let us consider some arbitrarily chosen levels of profit in Figure 11.10:\n\n$350 by selling 35 units of X or 25 units of Y\n$700 by selling 70 units of X or 50 units of Y\n$620 by selling 62 units of X or 44.3 units of Y.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.10: Linear program example: Isoprofit lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the solution, begin at some feasible solution (satisfying the given constraints) such as \\((x,y) = (0,0)\\), and proceed in the direction of steepest ascent of the profit function (in this case, by increasing production of Y at $14.00 profit per unit) until some constraint is reached. Since assembly hours are limited to 80, no more than 80/2, or 40, units of Y can be made, earning \\(40 \\cdot \\$14.00\\), or $560 profit. Then proceed along the steepest allowable ascent from there (along the assembly constraint line) until another constraint (machining hours) is reached. At that point, (x,y) = (20,30) and profit P = (20 * +10.00) + (30 * +14.00), or $620. Since there is no remaining edge along which profit increases, this is the optimum solution.",

I will not go into detail here, but I will show some examples of how to come to a decision when certain information is given.\nFor a deeper understanding of the microeconomic preliminaries related to this topic, please read section Chapter 8 of the appendix.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.12: Contours of the function and the constraint in red\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lagrange multiplier method, named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange (see Figure 11.11), is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to constraints. The red curve in Figure 11.12 represents the constraint \\(g(x, y) = c\\), while the blue curves depict contours of \\(f(x, y)\\). The point where the red constraint tangentially intersects a blue contour represents the maximum of \\(f(x, y)\\) along the constraint, as \\(d1 &gt; d2\\).\nFor a detailed visual explanation of the method, you can watch Dr. Trefor Bazett’s YouTube video, see Figure 11.13.\n\n\n\nFigure 11.13: Lagrange Multiplier graphically explained\n\n\n\nSource: Youtube\n\n\n\nThe Lagrange multiplier method, named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems with constraints.It allows us to find the local maxima and minima of a function subject to certain conditions. The method involves four key steps:\nStep 1: Formulate the Problem\nDefine the problem you want to solve in mathematical terms. This includes specifying the objective function to be maximized or minimized and the constraints that need to be satisfied.\nThe problem that we want to solve can be written in the following way, \\[\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n    \\max _{x, y} & F(x, y) \\\\\n    \\text{ s.t. } & g(x, y)=0\n\\end{array}\n\\] where \\(F(x, y)\\) is the function to be maximized and \\(g(x, y)=0\\) is the constraint to be respected. Notice that \\(\\max _{x, y}\\) means that we must solve (maximize) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nStep 2: Construct the Lagrangian\nCreate a new function called the Lagrangian by combining the objective function and the constraints using Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian introduces new variables, known as Lagrange multipliers, to account for the constraints. The Lagrangian, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), is a combination of the functions that explain the problem: The \\(\\lambda\\) is called the Lagrange Multiplier. \\[\n\\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda)=F(x, y)-\\lambda g(x, y)\n\\]\nStep 3: Determine the First-Order Conditions\nDifferentiate the Lagrangian with respect to the variables of the problem (e.g., x and y) and the Lagrange multipliers. Set the partial derivatives equal to zero to obtain the first-order conditions. These conditions represent the necessary conditions for optimality.\nDifferentiate \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) w.r.t. \\(x, y,\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) and equate the partial derivatives to 0: \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda)}{\\partial x}=0 & \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{\\partial F(x, y)}{\\partial x}-\\lambda \\frac{\\partial g(x, y)}{\\partial x}=0 \\\\\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda)}{\\partial y}=0 & \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{\\partial F(x, y)}{\\partial y}-\\lambda \\frac{\\partial g(x, y)}{\\partial y}=0 \\\\\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda}=0 & \\Leftrightarrow g(x, y)=0\n\\end{align*}\\]\nStep 4: Solve the System of Equations\nSolve the system of equations obtained from the first-order conditions to find the values of the variables and Lagrange multipliers that satisfy the optimality conditions. The solutions represent the optimal quantities that maximize or minimize the objective function subject to the given constraints.\nBy following these four steps, you can effectively apply the Lagrange multiplier method to various optimization problems with constraints. It provides a systematic approach to finding the optimal solutions while incorporating the necessary trade-offs imposed by the constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11.4 Burgers and drinks\nSuppose you are in a fast food restaurant and you want to buy burgers and some drinks. You have €12 to spend, a burger costs €3 and a drink costs €2.\n\nAssume that you want to spend all your money and that you can only buy complete units of each products.

(2022, ch. 5)\nLearning objectives:\nStudents will be able to:\nElasticity is the measurement of the percentage change of one economic variable in response to a change in another. Here, elasticity refers to the degree to which individuals, consumers, or producers change their demand or the amount supplied in response to price or income changes. Elasticity is a normalized measure, meaning the units of measurement of the variables (€, cent, kg, g) do not play a role, enabling comparisons of how different goods react to price changes, for example.\nThe price elasticity of demand (PED) is computed as the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price:\n\\[ \\text{PED} = \\frac{\\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\\text{Percentage change in price}} = \\frac{\\frac{q_{t=\\text{today}} - q_{t=\\text{yesterday}}}{q_{t=\\text{yesterday}}}}{\\frac{p_{t=\\text{today}} - p_{t=\\text{yesterday}}}{p_{t=\\text{yesterday}}}}  \\]",

We would be comparing apples with pears, or in this case, cookies with milk, as the units of measurement are different.\nLet’s calculate the elasticities:\nExample milk: If the price of a liter of milk increases from €0.50 to €0.70, and the amount demanded falls from 10 to 6 liters, then the price elasticity of demand (PED) for milk is calculated as:\n\\[\nPED_{milk}^*=\\frac{\\frac{6-10}{10}\\cdot 100}{\\frac{(\\text{€}0.70 - \\text{€}0.50)}{\\text{€}0.50}\\cdot 100} = -1\n\\]\nExample cookie: If the price of a cookie increases from €0.20 to €0.40 and the amount demanded falls from 3 to 1 cookie, then the price elasticity of demand (PED) for cookies is:\n\\[\nPED_{cookie}^*=\\frac{\\frac{1-3}{3}\\cdot 100}{\\frac{(\\text{€}0.40-\\text{€}0.20)}{\\text{€}0.20}\\cdot 100}=-\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\nThis means if the price increases by 1%, Rachel will demand 1% less of milk and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)% less of cookies. Thus, we can conclude that she is more price-sensitive to milk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12.2 Check for units of measurement and direction of change\n\nAssume a cookie weighs 100g and we use $ as currency, with one dollar equal to €0.86. Recalculate the \\(PED_{cookie}\\) using grams as the unit of measurement.\n\nYou may have heard that the problem with the simple method of calculation is that the precise magnitude of the elasticity depends on the direction of change. Thus, calculate the elasticities if the prices decrease from €0.70 to €0.50 and from €0.20 to €0.40, respectively. In other words, assume that quantities and prices from the earlier example change in the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck: Units of Measurement\nTo convert €0.20 to $, calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{€}0.40 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{\\$}1}{\\text{€}0.86} = \\text{\\$}0.465116279\n\\] and hence €0.20 = 0.23255814$. Then,\n\\[\nPED_{cookie}^* = \\frac{\\frac{100g - 300g}{300g} \\cdot 100}{\\frac{(\\text{\\$}0.465116279 - \\text{\\$}0.23255814)}{\\text{\\$}0.23255814} \\cdot 100} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n\\] Check: it remains the same.\n\nCheck: Direction of Change\n\\[\nPED_{milk}^* = \\frac{\\frac{10 - 6}{6} \\cdot 100}{\\frac{(\\text{€}0.50 - \\text{€}0.70)}{\\text{€}0.70} \\cdot 100} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{2}{7}} = -\\frac{7}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nPED_{cookie}^* = \\frac{\\frac{3 - 1}{1} \\cdot 100}{\\frac{(\\text{€}0.20 - \\text{€}0.40)}{\\text{€}0.40} \\cdot 100} = -4\n\\]\nThe result is significantly different. Thus, this method of calculation is inadequate.\nSolution: Midpoint Method, see ?sec-midpoint.",

It is termed perfectly elastic when \\(|PED| \\rightarrow \\infty\\), indicating that quantity responds infinitely to even the smallest price change. Conversely, it is labeled perfectly inelastic when \\(PED = 0\\), signifying that quantity does not respond at all to price changes.\nIn less extreme cases, we refer to price inelastic demand when \\(0 &lt; |PED| &lt; 1\\), meaning that quantity demanded does not respond significantly to changes in price. On the other hand, price elastic demand occurs when \\(|PED| &gt; 1\\), indicating a strong responsive relationship between quantity demanded and price.\nUnderstanding PED is crucial as it measures the sensitivity of quantity demanded to price changes and is closely related to the slope of the demand curve. However, it is important to note that the slope alone does not provide the complete picture of PED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12.4 Sketch demand curves\n\nSketch demand curves for\n\nNormal goods with price inelastic demand\nNormal goods with perfect price inelastic demand\nNormal goods with price elastic demand\nNormal goods with perfect price elastic demand\n\nDo the same for a Giffen good.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeterminants of PED: Several factors influence the price elasticity of demand. The availability of close substitutes plays a significant role, as does the classification of goods into necessities versus luxuries. Additionally, the time horizon can impact elasticity.\nPrice elasticity of a linear demand curve {#sec-slopedemand}:\nWhen examining the price elasticity of a linear demand curve, it is essential to recognize that while the slope remains constant, elasticity does not! Demand is typically inelastic at points with low prices and high quantities, whereas it becomes elastic at points with high prices and low quantities. This is demonstrated in Figure 12.1 and Figure 12.2.\nMoreover, total revenue varies at each point along the demand curve. Demand curves with a constant price elasticity are referred to as iso-elastic.

    "text": "13.1 Theorems of welfare economics\nIn previous chapters, we have discussed the power of free markets to allocate resources efficiently. However, the magic of the price system actually requires markets to be perfect. Unfortunately, perfect competition is never found in the real world. However, it is a useful theoretical model that serves as a reference point for analyzing real-world markets. It provides valuable insights into market functioning and informs policymakers on how to address instances of market failure, where at least one assumption of perfect markets is not met.\nUsually, in real markets, the conditions of perfect markets are not given. However, that does not mean that such imperfect markets perform worse than non-market-based solutions of centrally planned economies, for example.\nTheory would predict that if firms in an industry make some profits, new firms will enter the market or existing firms will produce more, which both yield an increase in supply. That, in turn, will drive down market prices until all firms earn zero profits and no more firms have an incentive to enter the market. In equilibrium, total revenue equals total cost. Thus, firms do not make profits. Firms can only make profits if they have some sort of competitive advantage and hence are not price takers, which would contradict assumption 1. The most extreme form of competitive advantage is a monopoly. It describes a situation where one firm is the only provider of a certain good or service. This firm can set prices and control the supply of the good or service completely. We will discuss that extreme case in the next section.\nThere are two fundamental theorems of welfare economics. The first states that a market in equilibrium under perfect competition will be Pareto optimal in the sense that no further exchange would make one person better off without making another worse off. The requirements for perfect competition are as follows:",

When thinking of a race where runners compete, all runners give their best effort, and the fastest runner wins. This outcome is efficient because each runner is motivated to perform their best to achieve their individual goals, which collectively leads to an optimal overall result. Each runner receives a fair price.\nIf the race starts with an uneven advantage, the market (or race) isn’t efficient initially. However, the second theorem suggests that by redistributing starting positions or providing compensation to less advantaged runners, an efficient outcome can still be achieved. In the economic context, this means that with appropriate policies (taxes, subsidies, etc.), markets can be used to attain efficient outcomes even when the initial distribution is unequal.\nIn summary, the example of runners in track and field helps illustrate how the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics emphasize the efficiency achieved by competitive markets and the possibility of achieving efficient outcomes through redistribution. Just as runners compete to achieve their best, competitive markets can lead to optimal resource allocation, and policies can ensure fairness and efficiency in the allocation process.",

The curve suggests that there exists a tax rate that maximizes government revenue.

    "text": "14.1 Introduction\nRecommended reading:\nEmerson (2019, ch. 15), Anon (2020, ch. 10)\nLearning objectives:\nStudents will be able to:\nA monopolist is a firm that is the only provider of a good or service. There is no close substitute to it. The ability of a monopolist to raise its price above the competitive level by reducing output is known as market power. This implies a loss of total welfare. In contrast with a perfectly competitive firm which faces a perfectly elastic demand (taking price as given), a monopolist faces the market demand. As a consequence, a monopolist has the power to set the market price. While we can consider a competitive firm as a price taker, a monopolist is price decision-maker or price setter. Firms that have to face fierce competition are more like price takers as they cannot set the price above the market price. If firms in perfect competition would set the price higher, all consumers would simply stop buying from that particular firm. That is not the case for a firm with market power, that is, a firm that has a product with unique features no other competitor has to offer.\nIn real markets, it is challenging to find a 100% clear monopoly, as there is usually some form of substitute available—even if imperfect. Nonetheless, several sectors in Germany are characterized by natural or legal monopolies. Deutsche Bahn (DB), the state-owned railway company, holds a near-monopoly on long-distance rail infrastructure and many regional routes, with only limited competition from private operators. Deutsche Post (DHL Group), although officially deregulated since 2008, continues to dominate traditional mail delivery, particularly for letters and official documents, and maintains a strong position in logistics. The Federal Printing Office (Bundesdruckerei) holds a monopoly on the production of sensitive government documents such as passports, ID cards, and tax labels. Additionally, municipal utilities (Stadtwerke) in many German towns operate as local monopolies for electricity, water, and gas supply, even though the energy market itself is open to alternative providers.",

The demand function is a complete description of the demanded quantity at each price, whereas the inverse demand gives us the maximum price at which a given output \\(x\\) may be sold in the market.\nThus, an increase in production by a monopolist has two opposing effects on revenue:\n\nA quantity effect: one more unit is sold, increasing total revenue by the price at which the unit is sold.\nA price effect: in order to sell the last unit, the monopolist must cut the market price on all units sold. This decreases total revenue.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: Price effects and revenue\n\n\n\nSource: Graph is taken from Emerson (2019). \n\n\n\nThe two effects are shown in figure Figure 14.1: At price \\(p_1\\), the total revenue is \\(p_1 \\cdot Q_1\\), which is represented by the areas A+B. At price \\(p_2\\), the total revenue is \\(p_2 \\cdot Q_2\\), which is represented by the areas A+C. Area A is the same for both, so the marginal revenue is the difference between B and C or C-B. Note that area C is the price, \\(p_2\\), times the change in quantity, \\(Q_2 - Q_1\\), or \\(p \\Delta Q\\); and area B is the quantity, \\(Q_1\\), times the change in price, \\(p_2 - p_1\\), or \\(\\Delta p \\cdot Q\\). Since \\(p_2 - p_1\\) is negative, the change in total revenue is C-B or: \\(\\Delta TR = p \\Delta Q + \\Delta p \\cdot Q\\).

    "text": "14.9 Price discrimination\nDiscrimination is the practice of treating people differently based on some (irrelevant) characteristic, such as race or gender. It is important to actively fight discrimination whenever it is observed. However, the concept of discrimination takes a different form when it comes to price discrimination, which is a business practice involving the sale of the same goods at different prices to different buyers. This practice can be commonly seen in special offers tailored for students or retired individuals.\nOne of the key factors utilized in price discrimination is the willingness to pay (WTP) of individuals. By charging a higher price to buyers with a higher WTP, a firm can maximize its profit. Moreover, and that is kind of surprising, it also comes with a increase in social welfare as is shown in figure Figure 14.5 and figure Figure 14.5. In Figure 14.5, the monopolist charges the same price (PM) to all buyers. A deadweight loss results. In Figure 14.5, however, the monopolist produces the competitive quantity but charges each buyer his or her WTP. This is called perfect price discrimination. The monopolist captures all consumer surplus as profit. But there is no deadweight loss.\n\n\n\nFigure 14.4: Monopoly without price discrimination and welfare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.5: Monopoly with price discrimination and welfare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the real world, price discrimination is a common phenomenon, but achieving perfect price discrimination is highly challenging. This is primarily because no firm possesses complete knowledge of every buyer’s willingness to pay (WTP), and buyers typically do not disclose this information to sellers. Consequently, firms often divide customers into groups based on observables that are likely correlated with their WTP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14.3 Name and discuss examples of price discrimination in real markets.",

    "text": "15.1 Positive and negative externalities\nAn externality is an uncompensated impact of one economically active unit’s (person or firm) actions on the well-being of a bystander. It arises when a person engages in an activity that affects the well-being of a bystander and yet neither pays nor receives any compensation for that effect.\nWhen the impact on the bystander is adverse, the externality is called a negative externality. When the impact on the bystander is beneficial, the externality is called a positive externality. Externalities cause markets to be inefficient and thus fail to maximize total surplus. Buyers/consumers and sellers/producers neglect the external effects of their actions. (Otherwise, the effects wouldn’t be considered to be external.)\nWatch the video shown in Figure 15.1.\nExample: Aluminum industry\nBackground: Aluminum factories emit pollution (a negative externality). For each unit of aluminum produced, a certain amount of smoke enters the atmosphere. The smoke poses a health risk for innocent bystanders who breathe the air.\nHow does a negative externality affect the efficiency of the market outcome?\nOne solution: Policymakers can tax aluminum producers for each ton of aluminum sold. The tax shifts the supply curve upward by the size of the tax. The tax should reflect the external cost of pollutants released into the atmosphere (in order to match the social-cost curve). The new market equilibrium would result in the socially optimal quantity of aluminum.\nAnother solution: Internalizing the externality: Altering incentives so that people and firms account for the external effects of their actions.\nAlternatives: If property rights were clearly defined, we would have a (theoretical) chance of a market solution. However, the transaction costs are probably simply too high, as all people are harmed, necessitating that all people bargain with the polluting firms.",

It states that if property rights exist and transaction costs are low, private transactions are efficient. In other words, with property rights and low transaction costs, there are no externalities. All costs and benefits are taken into account by the transacting parties. Thus, it doesn’t matter how the property rights are assigned as long as they are assigned. The theorem posits that if private parties can bargain without cost over the allocation of resources, they can solve the problem of externalities on their own. However, the theorem only works when the relevant parties can come to an agreement and are able to enforce that agreement. This is often not the case.\nTransaction costs, in this respect, refer to the costs that parties incur during the process of agreeing to and following through on a bargain. Efficient bargaining becomes increasingly difficult when the number of interested parties is large. Coordinating more people is costly, and the more individuals involved, the less likely it is that private transactions yield a successful, efficient market outcome.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: Ronald H.

For example, suppose there are two types of workers: lazy workers and hard workers. Each worker knows which they are, but employers cannot tell. If there is only one wage rate, lazy workers will be overpaid and hard workers will be underpaid relative to their productivity.\nAnother example is the secondhand car market. Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between a high-quality car (a cherry) and a low-quality car (a lemon), but sellers know the quality of their cars. Buyers would be willing to pay €6000 for a good car and €2000 for a bad car. If half of the cars for sale are good and half are bad, the market price of a car would be €4000.\nMoreover, the asymmetric information yields a so-called adverse selection problem. That is, used car sellers know they are getting far more than their cars are worth by selling at €4000, while owners of good cars know they are getting far less than their cars are really worth. Thus, more lemon owners are attracted into selling their cars than are cherry owners. This sort of market is known as a market for lemons, named after the article The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism by George Akerlof (1970) (see Figure 15.4), the Nobel laureate of 2001.\n\nAkerlof, G. (1970). The market for lemons: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84(3), 488–500.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: George A. Akerlof (*1940)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 15.2 Market failure review\n\nWhat is an external effect? Explain in detail and define the terms external benefit and external cost.\nWhat does it mean to internalize an external effect?\nWhat is a public good? Define briefly.\nWhat is the free-rider problem and how does government help to overcome it?\nWhy is it so important to have a monopoly control commission?\nWhat do property rights have to do with externalities? What are the conditions that must hold so that private market transactions can eliminate external effects?\nWhat are good reasons for the government to tax people and restrict civil rights and liberties?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn externality is a cost or benefit of a production or consumption activity that spills over to affect people other than those who decide the scale of the activity.\nAn external cost is the cost of producing a good or service that is not borne by its consumers or producers but by other people.\nAn external benefit is the benefit of consuming a good or service that does not accrue to its consumers or producers but to other people.\nIn order to eliminate market failures caused by externalities, it is necessary to intervene in the market in a way to encourage consumers and producers to change their rational choices so that they produce or purchase quantities that are closer to the social optimum, correcting efficiency deviations of externalities. This correction process is called internalization of externalities. In other words, when a person considers the consequences of his market transactions on individuals that are not part of the market transaction itself, we say he has internalized the external effects of his actions.\nA public good is a good or service that can be consumed simultaneously by everyone and from which no one can be excluded. Public goods are non-rival in consumption, meaning one person’s consumption of the good does not affect the quantity available for anyone else. Public goods are non-excludable if it is impossible to prevent someone from benefiting from a good without having paid for it.\nPublic goods create a free-rider problem. A free-rider is a person who consumes a good without paying for it. Markets fail to supply a public good because no one has an incentive to pay for it. The government can provide the public good and finance the costs with taxes and other duties. The challenge here is to find the optimal level of provision for public goods.\nThe rent-seeking behavior of a monopolist prevents the allocation of resources from being efficient. Markets fail when monopoly power exists, as a monopolist increases profit by restricting output and increasing price. A major activity of government is to regulate monopolies and enforce laws that prevent cartels and other restrictions on competition.\nIf property rights are assigned, externalities can be eliminated by private parties bargaining for a jointly optimal solution. This holds only if there are no transaction costs or other market imperfections, like imperfect information, and if enforcement is possible.\nAny sort of market failure can act as a legitimate reason for the government to intervene in the market. Economists, however, have different viewpoints regarding whether or not (and how) government should intervene. An often-mentioned criterion is the Pareto criterion: If an intervention yields a Pareto improvement, meaning a change that harms no one and helps at least one person, most economists would support the policy intervention. However, it is hard to think of any real-world market intervention that actually does not harm anybody. Thus, it is often – to some extent – a normative judgment whether to support a market intervention or not. The main argument for market interventions in the case of market failure is that the intervention can improve overall welfare; hence it is just a matter of redistributing endowments and output, respectively. In other words, when the overall output increases due to government action, those who were harmed by the intervention can be compensated so that nobody is worse off due to the government action, while at least some are better off. While this may be theoretically clear and true, it may be practically hard to implement because it is challenging to identify losers and to calculate their loss. Thus, any market intervention and government activity should be discussed transparently (especially with respect to normative views), with an open mind and by protecting minorities that may be the losers of a government action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 15.3 Externalities examples\nFor each of the examples below, the following questions will be answered:\n\nDoes an externality exist? If so, classify the externality as positive/negative (or both).\nIf an externality exists, determine whether the Coase theorem applies (i.e., is it possible or reasonably feasible to assign property rights and solve the problem?).\nIf an externality exists and the Coase Theorem does not apply, argue which of the government’s tools are best suited to address the issue: quantity regulation, taxes/subsidies, tradable permits, or something else.\n\nExamples:\n\nBritish Petroleum drills for oil in the Gulf Coast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. You can either think of there being a negative externality (accidents on oil rigs cause spills, which negatively affect other inhabitants of the Gulf states) or a positive externality (identifying where oil is allows other companies to drill for oil more effectively because they know where it is).\n\n\nIf oil spills only damage property, and these property owners can costlessly recoup costs in the legal system, then the drillers will internalize the impact of their drilling on the social cost of the oil spill. However, if it is hard to determine the true costs from an oil spill (e.g., it may be hard to figure out whether someone lost their job because of an oil spill or some other reason), then the Coase Theorem may not apply. In the positive externality case, it may be difficult to assign property rights to an oil field after it is identified, so the Coase Theorem may not apply.\n\n\nQuantity regulation on the amount of safety/advanced drilling technology investments seems feasible. One could also argue for subsidies for safer drilling technologies (or taxes on less safe technologies). Tradable permits seem difficult to implement here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon emissions from vehicles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. I drive my car which emits gases that harm others, whose harm I do not pay for.\n\n\nThe Coase Theorem is difficult to apply since it would require assigning property rights to those who are harmed. Since many of the harmed are dispersed (e.g., driving in Charlotte theoretically harms everyone in the world a small amount) and in some cases involves the “unborn” (future generations facing global warming), the feasibility of negotiated private contracts is highly questionable.\n\n\nIf we believe that the social marginal benefit curve is flat (horizontal), we would want to price the carbon using a tax. Quantity regulation would require different quantities for each producer of carbon, but each individual has different marginal costs, making this difficult. Perhaps we can also do quantity regulation with tradable permits to address the issue of not knowing the costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour upstairs neighbors throwing an awesome but loud party\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, an externality exists, but it may be positive or negative depending on your tastes and preferences.\n\n\nThe Coase Theorem would require the neighbors to own rights to holding the party. Then the neighbors would pay other neighbors to have (or not have) the party. This could work (so an answer of “yes” is fine). However, in reality, there are likely many different people affected by the party (e.g., multiple neighbors hate the noise). Bargaining with all parties may allow one party to “hold-up” the others, rendering the Coase theorem inapplicable.\n\n\nThe best solution may be a community agreement or regulation regarding noise levels during certain hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuying a car with added safety features that prevent drivers/passengers’ deaths in the event of an accident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt depends. If people drive more recklessly as a result of having a safer car, then buying the safety feature imposes a negative externality on other drivers. If having a safety feature does not change the likelihood of an accident or the impact on other cars, then there is no externality.\n\n\nThe Coase Theorem does not apply: it would be incredibly difficult to write a contract with those with whom you may eventually be engaged in a car accident.\n\n\nQuantity regulation (e.g., regulating the safety feature, or preventing it) or taxation would potentially correct the externality. It seems strange, but theoretically we would want to tax the safety feature if it leads to more reckless driving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing crying babies on a plane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, obviously negative.\n\n\nThe Coase Theorem does not apply.\n\n\nOne solution could be to tax parents who bring babies on the plane and redistribute that tax to those who are exposed to the crying around the baby on the plane. Airlines could also potentially intervene and lower the ticket price for everyone seated nearby who has to listen to the baby crying (or serve free drinks/snacks when a baby starts crying).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 15.4 Tax a market failure\nThe private marginal benefit (PMB) associated with a product’s consumption is given by:\n\\[\nPMB = 360 - 4Q\n\\]\nThe private marginal cost (PMC) associated with its production is:\n\\[\nPMC = 6Q\n\\]\nFurthermore, the marginal (external) damage (MD) associated with this good’s production is:\n\\[\nMD = 2Q\n\\]\nQuestions:\n\nCalculate how much private production and hence consumption is in a free market.\nCalculate the social optimal quantity consumed.\nAs there is an external effect, the government decides to intervene and correct the externality by imposing a tax of \\(T\\) per unit consumed. What tax should it set to achieve the social optimum?\nCan you think of other ways for the government to intervene?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate production and consumption in a free market:\nTo find the quantity produced and consumed in a free market, set PMB equal to PMC:\n\\[\nPMB = PMC\n\\]\n\\[\n360 - 4Q = 6Q\n\\]\nSolving this equation:\n\\[\n360 = 10Q\n\\]\n\\[\nQ_F^* = 36\n\\]\nAnswer: In a free market, 36 units are produced and consumed.\nSocial optimal quantity consumed:\nTo determine the socially optimal quantity, we must account for the marginal external damage (MD) by adding it to PMC. The equation becomes:\n\\[\nMD + PMC = PMB\n\\]\n\\[\n2Q + 6Q = 360 - 4Q\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\n8Q = 360 - 4Q\n\\]\nSolving for (Q_S^*):\n\\[\n12Q = 360\n\\]\n\\[\nQ_S^* = 30\n\\]\nAnswer: The social optimum quantity of consumption would be 30 units.\nTax to achieve the social optimum:\nTo determine the required tax (T), set PMB equal to PMC plus tax:\n\\[\nPMB = PMC + T\n\\]\nSubstituting (Q = 30):\n\\[\n360 - 4Q = 6Q + T\n\\]\nPlugging in (Q = 30):\n\\[\n360 - 4 \\cdot 30 = 6 \\cdot 30 + T\n\\]\n\\[\n360 - 120 = 180 + T\n\\]\n\\[\nT = 60\n\\]\nAnswer: A tax of 60 per unit of consumption would ensure that the social optimum quantity of 30 is consumed.\nOther regulations:\nOther government interventions could include:\n\nImposing a direct restriction on the quantity produced or consumed.\nImplementing subsidies for more environmentally friendly production methods.\nEstablishing tradeable permits for emissions related to the production of this good.\nPromoting public awareness campaigns about the negative externalities involved.",

Behavioral economics, pioneered by Amos Tversky (1937-1996) and 2002 Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahnemann (*1934), has identified several biases that explain why and when people fail to act perfectly rationally. In the following sections, we will explore some of the most prominent biases that arise from humans relying on heuristics in decision-making. Specifically, we will describe biases result from the use of availability, representative, and confirmation heuristics and can lead to flawed decision-making and negative outcomes for individuals and organizations. By recognizing and accounting for these biases, we can make better decisions.\nThe availability heuristic refers to our tendency to make judgments or decisions based on information that is easily retrievable from memory. For example, if someone hears a lot of news about a particular stock or investment, they may be more likely to invest in it, even if there are other better investment options available. This bias can also lead individuals to overestimate the frequency of certain events, such as the likelihood of a market crash, based on recent media coverage.",

Tips for avoiding the top 20 common investment mistakes (Version 1.0). CFA Institute; Accessed April 24, 2023. https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/support/future-finance/avoiding-common-investor-mistakes.pdf\n\nExpecting too much or using someone else’s expectations: Nobody can tell you what a reasonable rate of return is without having an understanding of you, your goals, and your current asset allocation.\nNot having clear investment goals: Too many investors focus on the latest investment fad or on maximizing short-term investment return instead of designing an investment portfolio that has a high probability of achieving their long-term investment objectives.\nFailing to diversify enough: The best course of action is to find a balance. Seek the advice of a professional adviser.\nFocusing on the wrong kind of performance: If you find yourself looking short term, refocus.\nBuying high and selling low: Instead of rational decision making, many investment decisions are motivated by fear or greed.\nTrading too much and too often: You should always be sure you are on track. Use the impulse to reconfigure your investment portfolio as a prompt to learn more about the assets you hold instead of as a push to trade.\nPaying too much in fees and commissions: Look for funds that have fees that make sense and make sure you are receiving value for the advisory fees you are paying.\nFocusing too much on taxes: It is important that the impetus to buy or sell a security is driven by its merits, not its tax consequences.\nNot reviewing investments regularly: Check in regularly to make sure that your investments still make sense for your situation and that your portfolio doesn’t need rebalancing.\nTaking too much, too little, or the wrong risk: Make sure that you know your financial and emotional ability to take risks and recognize the investment risks you are taking.\nNot knowing the true performance of your investments: Many investors do not know how their investments have performed in the context of their portfolio. You must relate the performance of your overall portfolio to your plan to see if you are on track after accounting for costs and inflation.\nReacting to the media: Using the news channels as the sole source of investment analysis is a common investor mistake. Successful investors gather information from several independent sources and conduct their own proprietary research and analysis.\nChasing yield: High-yielding assets can be seductive, but the highest yields carry the highest risks. Past returns are no indication of future performance. Focus on the whole picture and don’t get distracted while disregarding risk management.\nTrying to be a market timing genius: Market timing is very difficult and attempting to make a well-timed call can be an investor’s undoing. Consistently contributing to your investment portfolio is often better than trying to trade in and out in an attempt to time the market.\nNot doing due diligence: Check the training, experience, and ethical standing of the people managing your money. Ask for references and check their work on the investments they recommend. Taking the time to do due diligence can help avoid fraudulent schemes and provide peace of mind.\nWorking with the wrong adviser: An investment adviser should share a similar philosophy about investing and life in general. The benefits of taking extra time to find the right adviser far outweigh the comfort of making a quick decision.\nLetting emotions get in the way: Investing can bring up significant emotional issues that can impede decision-making. A good adviser can help construct a plan that works no matter what the answers to important financial questions are.\nForgetting about inflation: It’s important to focus on real returns after accounting for fees and inflation. Even if the economy is not in a massive inflationary period, some costs will still rise, so it’s important to focus on what you can buy with your assets, rather than their value in dollar terms.\nNeglecting to start or continue: Investment management requires continual effort and analysis to be successful. It’s important to start investing and continue to invest over time, even if you lack basic knowledge or have experienced investment losses.\nNot controlling what you can: While you can’t control what the market will bear, you can control how much money you save. Continually investing capital over time can have as much influence on wealth accumulation as the return on investment and increase the probability of reaching your financial goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 16.2 Heuristics can fail\nRespond to the following problems which are taken from Bazerman & Moore (2012, p. 15f). In class, we will discuss your answers and how they match with the mathematically correct solutions to these problems.\nProblem 1: Please rank the following causes of death in the United States between 1990 and 2000. Place a 1 next to the most common cause, 2 next to the second, and so on. - Tobacco - Poor diet and physical inactivity - Motor vehicle accidents - Firearms (guns) - Illicit drug use\nNow, estimate the number of deaths caused by each of these five causes between 1990 and 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Mokdad et al. (2004, p. 1240), the answer is the following order:\n\nTobacco\nPoor diet and physical inactivity\nMotor vehicle accidents\nFirearms (guns)\nIllicit drug use\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2: Estimate the percentage of words in the English language that begin with the letter “a.”\nProblem 3: Estimate the percentage of words in the English language that have the letter “a” as their third letter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people estimate that there are more words beginning with “a” than words in which “a” is the third letter. In fact, the latter are more numerous than the former. Words beginning with “a” constitute roughly 6 percent of English words, whereas words with “a” as the third letter make up more than 9 percent of English words.\n\n\n\nProblem 4: Lisa is thirty-three and pregnant for the first time. She is worried about birth defects like Down syndrome. Her doctor tells her there is only a 1 in 1,000 chance that a woman of her age will have a baby with Down syndrome. However, Lisa remains anxious and decides to get a test called the Triple Screen, which detects Down syndrome. The test is moderately accurate: when a baby has Down syndrome, the test gives a positive result 86% of the time. However, 5% of babies who don’t have Down syndrome also get a false positive. Lisa takes the test and gets a positive result. What are the chances that her baby has Down syndrome?\n\n0-20%\n\n21-40%\n\n41-60%\n\n61-80%\n\n81-100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people think that Lisa has a substantial chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. The test gets it right 86 percent of the time, right? That sounds rather reliable, doesn’t it? Well, it does, but we should not rely on our feelings here. It’s better to do the math, because the correct result would show that there is just a 1.7 percent chance of the baby having Down syndrome. Here is the proof for that small number:\nLet \\(A\\) be the event of the baby having Down syndrome and \\(B\\) the event of a positive test result. Then,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nP(A) &= 0.001 \\\\\nP(B \\mid A) &= 0.86 \\\\\nP(B \\mid \\neg A) &= 0.05 \\\\\nP(B) &= \\frac{999 \\cdot 0.05}{1000} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 0.86}{1000} = \\frac{50.81}{1000} = 0.05081 \\\\\nP(A \\mid B) &= \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{0.86 \\cdot 0.001}{0.05081} = 0.01693\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\nProblem 5: A town is served by two hospitals. In the larger hospital, about 45 babies are born each day. In the smaller hospital, about 15 babies are born daily. About 50% of all babies are boys. For a year, each hospital recorded days when more than 60% of the babies born were boys. Which hospital recorded more such days?\n\nThe larger hospital\n\nThe smaller hospital\n\nAbout the same (within 5%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMost individuals choose C, expecting the two hospitals to record a similar number of days on which 60 percent or more of the babies born are boys. However, statistics tell us that we are much more likely to observe 60 percent of male babies in a smaller sample than in a larger sample. Think about which is more likely: getting more than 60 percent heads in 3 flips of a coin or in 3,000 flips of a coin? Half of the time, 3 flips will produce more than 60 percent heads. But with 3,000 flips, it happens about 0.0001 percent of the time. Most people ignore sample size when judging probabilities.\n\n\n\nProblem 6: You and your spouse have had three daughters. Now expecting a fourth child, you wonder about the odds of having a boy. What is the best estimate of your chances of having another girl?\n\n6.25% (1 in 16), because the odds of getting four girls in a row is 1 in 16\n\n50% (1 in 2), because there is an equal chance of getting each gender\n\nSomewhere between 6.25% and 50%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMany assume that after having three girls, the probability of having another girl must be lower. However, the gender determination of each baby is independent; the chance remains 50 percent for each child, regardless of previous children.\n\n\n\nProblem 7: You manage a Major League Baseball team, and the 2005 season has just ended. Your job is to predict future player performance. You must estimate 2006 batting averages for nine players. Fill in your guesses in the right column:\n\n\n\nPlayer\n2005 Batting Average\nEstimated 2006 Batting Average\n\n\n\n\n1\n.215\n\n\n\n2\n.242\n\n\n\n3\n.244\n\n\n\n4\n.258\n\n\n\n5\n.261\n\n\n\n6\n.274\n\n\n\n7\n.276\n\n\n\n8\n.283\n\n\n\n9\n.305\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people predict that a player’s 2006 performance will be almost identical to their 2005 performance. However, statistics show the correlation between Major League Baseball players’ batting averages from one year to the next is only 0.4. This tendency is known as “regression to the mean”—the worst performers tend to improve, and the best tend to decline.\n\n\n\nProblem 8: Linda is 31, single, outspoken, and very smart. She majored in philosophy and was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice. Rank the following descriptions in order of how likely they are to describe Linda:\n\nLinda is a teacher in an elementary school.\n\nLinda works in a bookstore and takes yoga classes.\n\nLinda is active in the feminist movement.\n\nLinda is a psychiatric social worker.\n\nLinda is a member of the League of Women Voters.\n\nLinda is a bank teller.\n\nLinda is an insurance salesperson.\n\nLinda is a bank teller who is active in the feminist movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine your rank orderings of descriptions C, F, and H. Most people rank C as more likely than H, and H as more likely than F. However, a conjunction (being both a bank teller and a feminist) cannot be more probable than being a bank teller alone. This is a fundamental law of probability, but it’s commonly misunderstood due to representativeness bias.\n\n\n\nProblem 9: Take the last three digits of your phone number. Add a “1” to the front to form a four-digit number. Now, estimate whether the Taj Mahal was completed before or after this year.\n___ Before ___ After\nNow, make your best estimate of the actual year in which the Taj Mahal was completed: ___\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMost people are influenced by irrelevant information, such as their phone number.

    "text": "17.1 Exchange rates\nAn exchange rate indicates the value of one currency in relation to another. Exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact on the revenues, costs, and profits of businesses; they affect how much you can afford to spend and can even influence job security.\nPlease work on the questions posed in Exercise 17.1 and Exercise 17.2. They are designed to motivate an introduction the topic.\nThe most important economic indicators frequently discussed in the media and politics are Gross Domestic Product (GDP)1, the policy rate2, and the inflation rate3. These measures are designed to explain the functioning of economic markets and guide policymakers. However, the exchange rate is used less frequently in political and public debates, which I believe is a significant oversight for several reasons.\nFirstly, similar to the aforementioned measures, exchange rate movements have a substantial impact on both markets and individuals. Moreover, the exchange rate serves as an accurate measure that reflects real market movements more quickly than most other indicators. Overall, a solid understanding of exchange rates is crucial for making informed decisions, managing financial risks, optimizing operations, and strategically positioning companies in the global marketplace.\nBefore I explain this in greater detail, let me share my explanations for why the exchange rate is relatively unnoticed in public debates:\nWhile I cannot change the factors that contribute to the limited discussion of exchange rates, I can work to help you make sense of this topic. Before discussing the importance of the exchange rate in Section 17.3, let’s first define the rate:\nTo define the rate more formally, suppose the Euro (€) is the home currency and Turkish Lira (₺) the foreign currency, then the exchange rate in direct quotation (Preisnotierung) is \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}=\\frac{X \\text{€}}{Y \\text{₺}}\\] and the exchange rate in indirect quotation (Mengennotierung) is \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}=\\frac{Y \\text{₺}}{X \\text{€}}.\\]\nBoth rates contain the same information, but have different interpretations:\nAlternative interpretations:",

GDP should be rising, while the inflation and policy rates should ideally be low. In contrast, the exchange rate is not so straightforward because there isn’t a universally optimal exchange rate that everyone hopes for. The ideal rate depends on many factors, such as whether you want to buy goods from abroad or sell them to the rest of the world. Different stakeholders and investors will have varying preferences about the exchange rate. Many people, especially politicians, avoid the complexities of “it depends” arguments because it is challenging to make convincing cases based on intricate relationships.\nVolatility: The exchange rate is comparatively volatile, and its changes are difficult to predict.\nMultiple exchange rates: There isn’t just one exchange rate; there are many, as any currency can be exchanged for any other currency. This means that a country’s exchange rate may rise against currency A but fall against currency B.\nLimited political influence: The power of politics to directly and measurably influence a country’s exchange rate is limited.\nUnderstanding requirements: The impact of exchange rate movements on our lives requires a solid understanding of economic markets, which many people lack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExchange Rate\n\n\n\nThe price of one currency in terms of another is called an exchange rate.

    "text": "17.2 Relative prices and exchange rates\nAfter understanding the concept of exchange rates, let us consider how trade in goods between two countries operates when each country uses a different currency as its legal tender.\nLet us consider a stylized example: Assume the home country produces beer and the foreign country produces wine. If you want to exchange a beer for wine, the relative price indicates the amount of beer you need to provide in order to receive a unit of wine (in direct quotation) or the quantity of wine you will receive for a unit of beer (in indirect quotation).\nFor example, a relative price of 1 means you can exchange 1 liter of beer for 1 liter of wine. However, if we assume that beer is measured in 500 ml cans and wine in 1-liter bottles, the relative price denoted with \\(P^{\\frac{beer}{wine}}\\) would be represented as:\n\\[P^{\\frac{beer}{wine}}= \\frac{2 \\text{ cans of beer}}{1 \\text{ bottle of wine}}.\\]\nThis means you can exchange 2 cans of beer for one bottle of wine.\nIf the relative price increases, you will need to provide more beer to receive a bottle of wine. Conversely, if the relative price decreases, you will need to provide less beer to obtain a bottle of wine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative prices\n\n\n\nRelative prices determine the relative price of commodities across countries. For example, an increase in the price of foreign commodities makes imported commodities relatively more expensive and home commodities relatively cheaper for buyers at home.\n\n\nRelative prices are (directly) determined by exchange rates. To logically prove this statement, let us assume for simplicity an exchange rate of 1, \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}=E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}=1\\] and that a liter of beer costs 1 € at home and a wine costs 1 ₺ abroad. Thus, we can buy both a wine or a beer for 1 €. Due to the fact that we must pay the wine producer with ₺, we must convert the € beforehand. The process goes like visualized in Figure 17.4:\n\n\n\nFigure 17.4: One wine per Euro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, assume that the € appreciates and the exchange rate becomes \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}=0.5\\) and \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}}=2\\), respectively. Then, you receive more than one wine if we assume that the price of wine in ₺ remains unchanged. The process is visualized in Figure 17.5:\n\n\n\nFigure 17.5: Two wine per Euro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means, exchange rates determine the relative prices. If the home currency appreciates (depreciates), buying goods and services abroad becomes relative cheaper (more expensive).\nOf course, if many people now buy wine and aim to convert €  to ₺, this may impact the exchange rate and the price of wine. We come back to that later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExchange rates and relative prices\n\n\n\nThe exchange rate determines the relative price of commodities across countries. For example, an appreciation of a currency makes commodities more expensive for foreign buyers and in turn makes foreign commodities cheaper for buyers at home.",

    "text": "17.3 The importance of exchange rates\nHere is an incomplete list of arguments to emphasize the importance of exchange rates for economies, businesses, and individuals:\n\nImport/export costs: Exchange rate fluctuations determine the relative prices and hence affect the cost of importing goods and materials and the global demand for domestic products. An appreciation of the home currency makes imports relatively cheaper but exports more expensive for the rest of the world, while depreciation has the opposite effect.\nRevenue conversion: Multinational companies earn revenues in multiple currencies. Exchange rate changes can significantly impact the value of these revenues when converted back to the home currency, affecting overall profitability.\nForeign investments: Companies investing in foreign assets or operations need to understand exchange rates to forecast returns accurately and manage exchange rate risk.\nRisk management: Knowledge of exchange rates enables businesses to hedge against currency risk using financial instruments like forwards, futures, options, and swaps. This is crucial for stabilizing cash flows and protecting profit margins.\nMarket competitiveness: Exchange rates affect the relative cost competitiveness of goods and services in international markets. Companies need to understand these implications to price their products competitively and make strategic decisions about entering or exiting markets.\nMacroeconomic insights: Exchange rates are influenced by and also affect economic indicators such as inflation, interest rates, and economic growth. Understanding these relationships helps in making informed predictions about market conditions.\nContractual agreements: Businesses engaged in international trade must understand exchange rates to negotiate and structure contracts effectively, determining terms such as the currency of payment and exchange rate clauses.\nGovernment and Policy Understanding: Exchange rates are often influenced by governmental and central bank policies. Understanding the dynamics between exchange rates and policy decisions is vital for anticipating regulatory changes and their potential impact on business operations.",

    "text": "17.4 Trump, relative prices, and trade policy\nLet’s return to Trump’s Twitter message . Steel producers in the U.S. (and Donald Trump himself) are unhappy about a strong dollar (and a weak Turkish Lira) because it makes their products relatively expensive for Turkish buyers while making Turkish steel relatively cheap for U.S. consumers.\nTrump had two options to address this issue: altering the exchange rates or adjusting the relative prices of goods between countries. Changing the exchange rate directly is a challenging task. Although buying or selling currencies on the foreign exchange market can influence exchange rates, the market is so large that the actions Trump could take as President would have minimal impact (see Section 17.5). Adjusting policy rates could influence exchange rates more effectively, as we will discuss in Chapter 18. However, the Federal Reserve, which sets policy rates and thus has an impact on interest rates, operates independently from political orders. Consequently, Trump’s influence over their decisions is limited.\nAs a result, Trump chose to increase the price of foreign steel in the U.S. by introducing or raising tariffs. The approach works, American steel producing companies get protected from foreign competition and might sell more domestically. However, there many negative consequences that detoriate the overall welfare. Foremost, everybody in the U.S. must pay more for steel (and for products made with steel and aluminum). David Boaz, Executive Vice President of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, highlights this issue in his response on Twitter (see Figure 17.6).\n\n\n\nFigure 17.6: Who wins in the end?\n\n\n\nSource: Twitter\n\n\n\nTo quantify the costs of Mr. Trumps’s tariffs, let me quote the well-written article by Amiti et al. (2019) (p. 188-189):\n\nAmiti, M., Redding, S. J., & Weinstein, D. E. (2019). The impact of the 2018 tariffs on prices and welfare. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 33(4), 187–210.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We find that by December 2018, import tariffs were costing US consumers and the firms that import foreign goods an additional $3.2 billion per month in added tax costs and another $1.4 billion per month in deadweight welfare (efficiency) losses. Tariffs have also changed the pricing behavior of US producers by protecting them from foreign competition and enabling them to raise prices and markups, and we estimate that the combined effects of input and output tariffs have raised the average price of US manufacturing by 1 percentage point, which compares with an annual average rate of producer price inflation from 1990 to 2018 of just over 2 percentage points. US tariffs and the foreign retaliatory tariffs also affect international supply chains, and we estimate that if the tariffs that were in place by the end of 2018 were to continue, approximately $165 billion of trade per year will continue to be redirected in order to avoid the tariffs. We also show that the rise in tariffs has reduced the variety of products available to consumers.”\n\n\n\nIn addition, it can be argued that increased tariffs might actually make the dollar stronger. If buyers stop purchasing steel from Turkey due to higher tariffs, they will need fewer Turkish lira and therefore will exchange fewer U.S. dollars for Turkish lira. This reduced demand for Turkish lira could lead to a stronger dollar.\nWhile raising tariffs and initiating trade disputes could be a strategy to gain political support and possibly get re-elected, there is a general consensus among economists that raising tariffs usually leads to economic losses and detrimental outcomes for all countries involved.",

At this juncture, holders of ₺ are unwilling to part with more, and similarly, Euro holders are not inclined to exchange more.\n\nIn 2022, the daily (!) traded volume of currencies averaged approximately $ 7,506 billion, as highlighted in Table 17.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 17.1: Daily turnover of global foreign exchange market from 2001 to 2022 (in billion U.S. dollars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n2001\n2004\n2007\n2010\n2013\n2016\n2019\n2022\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n1.239\n1.934\n3.324\n3.973\n5.357\n5.066\n6.581\n7.506\n\n\nUSD\n1.114\n1.702\n2.845\n3.371\n4.662\n4.437\n5.811\n6.639\n\n\nEUR\n470\n724\n1.231\n1.551\n1.790\n1.590\n2.126\n2.292\n\n\nJPY\n292\n403\n573\n754\n1.235\n1.096\n1.108\n1.253\n\n\nGBP\n162\n319\n494\n512\n633\n649\n843\n968\n\n\nCNY\n0\n2\n15\n34\n120\n202\n285\n526\n\n\nAUD\n54\n116\n220\n301\n463\n349\n446\n479\n\n\nCAD\n56\n81\n143\n210\n244\n260\n332\n466\n\n\nCHF\n74\n117\n227\n250\n276\n243\n326\n390\n\n\nAll others combined\n170\n251\n568\n786\n1124\n1223\n1921\n2093\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All others combined are: HKD, SGD, SEK, KRW, NOK, NZD, INR, MXN, TWD, ZAR, BRL, DKK, PLN, THB, ILS, IDR, CZK, AED, TRY, HUF, CLP, SAR, PHP, MYR.\nSource: https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data (July 18, 2018).\n\n\n\n17.5.2 Actors on the FOREX\nAs indicated in Figure 17.8, there are several major players involved in trading on the foreign exchange market. In particular, commercial banks, multinational corporations and non-bank financial institutions, such as investment funds, play an important role in trading and speculation. Central banks also play a crucial role as they intervene to stabilize their national currency and thus influence the direction of the market.\n\n\n\nFigure 17.8: Players on the foreign exchange market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.5.3 The vehicle currency\nInstead of converting directly between two less common currencies, it’s more efficient to use a broadly accepted and stable currency as a vehicle. That means, if you want to exchange currency A to B. You do not exchange currency A directly to B but you convert currency A first to the vehicle currency C and then from C to B.\nAs depicted in Figure 17.9, around 32% of all currency transactions included the Euro while a notable 88% involved the U.S. Dollar which makes the Dollar the standard vehicle currency. The Dollar acts as a medium in transactions between currencies that do not directly trade with high volume. This can reduce transaction costs and streamline the process.\n\n\n\nFigure 17.9: Market share of leading foreign exchange currencies in 2019",

    "section": "17.6 Purchasing power parity assumption",
    "text": "17.6 Purchasing power parity assumption\nThe Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) assumption is also know as the law of one price. It says that in competitive markets with zero transportation costs and no trade barriers, identical goods have the same price all over the world when expressed in terms of the same currency. The idea behind this is that if differences in prices exist, profits can be made through international arbitrage, that is, the process of buying a good cheap in one country and selling the good with a profit in another country. This process can quickly equalize real price differences across countries.\nHowever, in the real world, prices differ substantially across countries (see the Big Mac Index in Table 17.2 and Exercise 17.5). The assumptions of the PPP do mostly not hold perfectly in reality: some goods and services are not trade-able, firms might have different degrees of market power across countries, and the transaction costs are not zero. Here are more reasons, why the PPP does not always apply, especially in the short run:\n\nTransportation costs are not zero. Shipping goods can be time consuming and expensive.\nMany goods and services, such as real estate or personal services, cannot be traded.\nInternational markets may be segmented due to regulatory barriers, tariffs and other trade restrictions.\nCountries have different consumption preferences. That means, the same basket of goods is not necessarily equally demanded. The willingness to pay for goods vary across countries often significantly.\nCountries impose different taxes and provide different subsidies on goods and services, which affects their prices and leads to deviations from PPPs.\nShort-term fluctuations in exchange rates may deviate from the values predicted by PPPs due to speculation, interest rate differentials and other factors.\nDifferences in inflation rates between countries may lead to deviations from PPP, especially in the short run.\nThe same product may be perceived differently in different countries due to brand names, quality differences or local customization, resulting in different prices.\nRegulations like warranty and product classifications are different and have an impact on the product and the willingness to pay for it.\nPolitical instability, war or economic sanctions can affect currency values and prices and lead to deviations from PPP.\nPrices of goods and services do not always adjust immediately to changes in the exchange rate, leading to short-term deviations from PPP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 17.5 Big Mac Index\nThe differences of prices across countries can be illustrated with the Economist’s Big Mac Index. It indicates the price of a Big Mac in different countries in terms of the US Dollar. Table 17.2 shows some countries with on average expensive and cheap Big Macs.\n\n\n\nTable 17.2: The price of a Big Mac across countries\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nSwitzerland\n$6.57 (6.50 CHF)\n\n\nSweden\n$5.83 (51.00 SEK)\n\n\nUnited States\n$5.51 (5.51 USD)\n\n\nNorway\n$5.22 (42 NOK)\n\n\nCanada\n$5.08 (6.65 CAD)\n\n\nEuro area\n$4.75 (4.56 EUR)\n\n\n…\n…\n\n\nEgypt\n$1.75 (31.37 EGP)\n\n\nUkraine\n$1.91 (50 UAH)\n\n\nRussia\n$2.09 (130 RUB)\n\n\nMalaysia\n$2.10 (8.45 MYR)\n\n\nIndonesia\n$2.19 (31,500 IDR)\n\n\nTaiwan\n$2.27 (69 TWD)\n\n\n\nSource: https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data (July 18, 2018).\n\n\n\n\nRead Wikipedia’s page on the Big Mac Index and discuss the Big-Mac-Index critically. Is it really a reasonable real-world measurement of purchasing power parity?\nCompare the Big-Mac-Index to the Mac-Index (see: themacindex.com) looking for price differences of the Mac mini M1 256GB. Why are the price differences for Apple products so much smaller compared to McDonald’s Big Mac? In case the website offline, here is a snapshot of it.)\nUsing the data of Table 17.2, calculate the exchange rate of Euros (EUR) to Swiss Francs (CHF) in both the direct and the indirect quotation. Interpret your result.\nCalculate how many Dollars you can buy with 100€. Then, use that dollars to buy Swiss Francs. How many Swiss Francs do you get?\nMultiple choice: Which of the following statements is true?\n\nThe table indicates that the Purchasing Power Parity Assumption is fulfilled.\nThe exchange rate of US Dollar to Swiss Franc (CHF) is close to one.\nThe exchange rate of US Dollar to the Russian Ruble (RUB) is about \\(62.2 \\frac{\\$}{RUB}\\).\nThe exchange rate of Canadian Dollar (CAD) to the Euro (EUR) is about \\(0.73\\).\nWith one Canadian Dollar (CAD) you can buy \\(0.73\\) US Dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Big Mac Index\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease take part in the discussion in class.\nPlease take part in the discussion in class.\nThe exchange rate of Euros to Swiss Francs in direct quotation is: \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{ EUR}}{\\text{ CHF}}}=\\frac{4.56 \\text{ EUR}}{4.75 \\text{ USD}} \\cdot \\frac{6.57 \\text{ USD}}{6.50 \\text{ CHF}} = \\frac{29.9592 \\text{ EUR}}{30.875 \\text{ CHF}} \\approx 0.9703 \\frac{\\text{ EUR}}{\\text{ CHF}}\\] and in indirect quotation: \\[E^{\\frac{\\text{ CHF}}{\\text{ EUR}}} \\approx 1.0305 \\frac{\\text{ CHF}}{\\text{ EUR}}.\\] That means, we have to pay about 0.97 Euro for one Swiss Franc or one Euro costs about 1.03 Swiss Franc.\nFor 100 Euro we get \\[100 \\text{ EUR} \\cdot \\frac{4.75 \\text{ USD}}{4.56\\text{ EUR}} \\approx 104.16 \\text{ USD}\\] and these can be converted to \\[104.16 \\text{ USD} \\cdot  \\frac{6.50 \\text{ CHF}}{6.57\\text{ USD}} \\approx 103.05 \\text{ CHF}\\]\nHere are the answers:\n\nis false: The price of a Big Mac in $ is different across countries.\nis correct.\n\nis false: 1 Ruble costs 0.0160 Dollar: \\[ \\frac{2.09\\text{ USD}}{130 \\text{ RUB}} = 0.016\\frac{\\text{ USD}}{\\text{RUB}}.\\]\nis incorrect: \\[\n\\underbrace{\\frac{6.65 \\text{ CAD}}{5.08 \\text{ USD}}}_{\\approx 1.309}\\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{4.75 \\text{ USD}}{4.56 \\text{ EUR}}}_{\\approx 1.0416} \\approx 1.36\\frac{\\text{ CAD}}{\\text{EUR}}.\n\\]\nis incorrect: \\[\n\\frac{6.05 \\text{ CAD}}{5.08 \\text{ USD}} \\approx 0.76 \\frac{\\text{ CAD}}{\\text{ USD}}.\n\\] Thus, with one Canadian Dollar you can buy 0.76 U.S. Dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 17.6 International arbitrage\n\n\n\nTable 17.3: Table of price variations across countries\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nPrice of Good 08/15\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n$2\n\n\nSwitzerland\n$6\n\n\nUnited States of America\n$6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a scenario where the good 08/15 is freely tradeable across countries without any cost (akin to digital software).

Discuss how you could profit from international arbitrage, the practice of exploiting price differences of a good across countries. Describe the potential impact on the prices of the good once arbitrage begins.\nAssuming 08/15 can be traded freely across borders like software, imagine your arbitrage efforts have harmonized the prices of the good worldwide, as illustrated in the Table 17.4:\n\n\n\n\nTable 17.4: Table of prices and currencies across countries post-arbitrage\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nPrice in USD\nPrice in Local Currency\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n$4\nEUR 2\n\n\nSwitzerland\n$4\nCHF 6\n\n\nUnited States of America\n$4\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, calculate and elucidate the following exchange rates:\n\n\\(\\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{EUR}}\\)\n\\(\\frac{\\text{EUR}}{\\text{USD}}\\)\n\\(\\frac{\\text{USD}}{\\text{CHF}}\\)\n\\(\\frac{\\text{CHF}}{\\text{USD}}\\)\n\\(\\frac{\\text{CHF}}{\\text{EUR}}\\)\n\\(\\frac{\\text{EUR}}{\\text{CHF}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational arbitrage strategy\n\nStrategy: Buy 50 units of good 08/15 in Germany for $2 each with your $100. Then, sell these units in Switzerland or the USA for $6 each, making a total of $300. This is a classic arbitrage strategy.\nImpact on Prices: Consider that you repeat that winning strategy to buy in Germany and sell in some other country, prices will change: The increased demand in Germany will cause the price there to rise, while the increased supply in Switzerland and the USA will cause the price to drop. Eventually, the price differences will equalize, eliminating the arbitrage opportunity.\n\nCalculating exchange rates\n\n\nUSD to EUR: \\(\\frac{4 USD}{2 EUR} = 2\\frac{USD}{EUR}\\)\nEUR to USD: \\(0.5 \\frac{EUR}{USD}\\)\nUSD to CHF: \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\frac{USD}{CHF}\\)\nCHF to USD: \\(1.5 \\frac{CHF}{USD}\\)\nCHF to EUR: \\(\\frac{3}{1} \\frac{CHF}{USD}\\)\nEUR to CHF: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\frac{EUR}{CHF}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 17.7 Brexit and the exchange rate\nExamine Figure 17.10 and discuss the reasons behind the depreciation of the British pound since June 2016.\n\n\n\nFigure 17.10: The Price of the British Pound (€/£)\n\n\n\nSource: Süddeutsche Zeitung am Wochenende, 17./18.

    "text": "18.1 Foreign exchange reserves\nInvesting, whether through holding a currency or storing purchasing power, is inherently speculative, regardless of whether the investment is domestic or international. When you hold a foreign currency, it’s crucial to acknowledge that its value can both appreciate and depreciate. Currency values can fluctuate significantly over time due to factors such as economic policy, market sentiment, and global events. In the following sections, I will present a framework to help understand the key determinants of the rate of return on your investment. As illustrated in Figure 18.1, we will explore how a country’s interest rates, trade balances, price levels, and exchange rates are interconnected and must be analyzed together, rather than in isolation.\nCurrencies serve as a store of value, an important function in the financial world. Foreign exchange reserves are assets held on reserve by a central bank in foreign currencies, which can include bonds, treasury bills, and other government securities. The primary purpose of holding foreign exchange reserves is to manage the exchange rate of the national currency and ensure the stability of the country’s financial system.\nAccordingly to the Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COVER) database of the International Moentary Fund (IMF), the total foreign exchange reserves in Q3 2023 had been 11,901,53 billion U.S. Dollar. That is, $ 11,901,530,000,000!\nThe size of a country’s foreign exchange reserves can be influenced by various factors, including its balance of trade, exchange rate policies, capital flows, and the overall health of its economy. While having substantial reserves is generally seen as a sign of economic strength and stability, excessively accumulating reserves can also indicate underlying economic imbalances or protectionist policies.",

    "text": "18.2 Three components of the rate of return\nAn investment usually has different characteristics such as the default risk, opportunities, and liquidity. These characteristics and individual preferences are important to decide which investment is superior. In this course, however, we mostly refrain from discussing sophisticated features of investments here. We focus on the most important feature of an investment, that is, the rate of return. In particular, three components are important to calculate the rate of return:\n\n18.2.1 Interest rate\nThe interest rate of an investment is a crucial factor that determines the return earned on invested capital over a specific period. It represents the percentage of the initial investment that is paid back to the investor as interest or profit. Formally, we can write: \\[\n\\underbrace{I_{t-1}}_{\\text{investment in {t-1}}} \\cdot\\quad \\underbrace{(1+i)}_{1+\\text{interest rate}} = \\underbrace{I_{t}}_{\\text{payout amount in t}}\n\\tag{18.1}\\] where \\(I\\) denotes the value of an asset measured in € in the respective time period \\(t\\).\n\n\n18.2.2 Exchange rate\nWhen investing in assets denominated in foreign currencies, investors need to convert their domestic currency into the foreign currency at the prevailing exchange rate. After the investment has been paid out in the foreign country, the investor must convert the foreign currency back to his home currency. Thus, the initial cost of the investment and the subsequent returns are influenced by the exchange rate at the beginning and the end of the investment.\nFormally, we can write if the an investment takes in foreign country, that is, Turkey between \\(t-1\\) and \\(t\\): \\[\nI^{\\text{€}}_{t-1}\\cdot E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}} \\cdot E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}= I_{t}^{\\text{€}}\n\\tag{18.2}\\]\n\n\n18.2.3 Inflation\nInflation refers to the quantitative measure of the rate at which prices, represented by a basket of goods and services, increase within an economy over a specific period. Conversely, negative inflation is termed deflation. Mathematically, inflation can be defined as follows:\n\\[\n\\pi = \\frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\pi\\) represents the inflation rate and \\(P_t\\) denotes the price at time \\(t\\). When inflation affects all prices, it also impacts the value of assets in which investors are invested. This relationship can be expressed as:\n\\[\nI_t = I_{t-1} \\cdot (1+\\pi)\n\\tag{18.3}\\]",

    "section": "18.3 Rate of return of an investment abroad",
    "text": "18.3 Rate of return of an investment abroad\nThe rate of return, \\(r\\), is the growth rate of an investment over time and can be described as follows: \\[\\begin{align*}\nr=& \\frac{I^{\\text{€}}_t-I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}}{I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}}=\\frac{I^{\\text{€}}_t}{I^{\\text{€}}_{t-1}}-1,\n\\end{align*}\\]\nCombining Equation 18.1, Equation 18.2, and Equation 18.3, we can describe the value of our investment in period \\(t\\) as follows: \\[\nI_{t}^{\\text{€}}= I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}} \\cdot (1+i^{*}) \\cdot E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}} \\cdot E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}} \\cdot  (1+\\pi^{*}),\n\\tag{18.4}\\] where \\(I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}\\) denotes the initial investment, \\(i^{*}\\) denotes the interest rate abroad and \\(\\pi^{*}\\) the inflation abroad. Dividing by \\(I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}\\) and subtracting \\(1\\) from both sides of Equation 18.4, we see that the rate of return for an investment abroad, \\(r^{*}\\), has three determining factors, that are: interest rate \\((1+i^*)\\), inflation \\((1+\\pi)\\), and the change of exchange rates over time \\((E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}} \\cdot E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}})\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\underbrace{\\frac{I_{t}^{\\text{€}}}{I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}}-1}_r^*&=\n(1+i^{*})\\cdot  (1+\\pi^{*}) \\cdot \\underbrace{E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}} \\cdot E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}}_\\alpha -1\n\\end{align*}\\] \\[ r^*= (1+i^{*})\\cdot  (1+\\pi^{*}) \\cdot \\alpha -1  \\tag{18.5}\\] with\n\n\\(\\alpha=1\\) if the exchange rate does not change over time and\n\n\\(\\alpha&gt;1\\) if the home currency € depreciates or\n\\(\\alpha&lt;1\\) if the home currency € appreciates.\n\nSo the exchange rate changes over time work as a third factor of your rate of return.\nBy assuming no inflation (\\(\\pi^{*}=0\\)), we can write\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nr^*&=(1+i^{*}) \\cdot \\alpha -1\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=\\alpha +\\alpha i^{*}  -1.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{18.6}\\] Reorganizing Equation 18.6 helps to interpret it. Firstly, let us expand the right hand side of this equation adding and subtracting \\(i^*\\) which obviously does not change the sum of the right hand side of the equation. Secondly, re-write the equation and thirdly, set \\((\\alpha-1)=w\\): \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=\\alpha +\\alpha i^{*}-1+i^*-i^*\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=\\alpha-1+i^* +\\alpha i^{*}-i^*\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=\\underbrace{(\\alpha -1)}_w+i^* +i^{*}\\underbrace{(\\alpha -1)}_w\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r^*&=w+i^* +i^{*}w\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{18.7}\\]\nThis equation outlines the rate of return on an investment in a foreign country, influenced by two primary factors: \\(i^*\\) and \\(w\\).\nAssuming that the product \\(iw\\) is very small, we can say that the rate of return equals approximately the interest rate plus the rate of depreciation: \\[r^{*}=w+i^{*}.\\] This approximation is often called the simple rule for \\(r\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 18.1 Exchange rates and where to invest\nSuppose you want to buy a new car in Germany in one year, i.e, t=2023. Today, i.e., t=2022, you have €10,000 to invest for one year.\nGiven the following conditions:\n\nThe annual interest rate in Europe is 1%.\nThe annual interest rate in the U.S.A. is 2%.\nOne US-Dollar can be converted to €0.93 this year.\nYou expect that €1 can be converted to $1.09 next year.\nMoreover, you expect no inflation in Germany and the U.S.\nNo banking fees or alike.\n\n\nCalculate the return on an investment in the U.S. and Germany, respectively.\nDo you expect the euro to appreciate or depreciate from 2022 to 2023?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nExchange rates and where to invest (Exercise 18.1)\n\nRate of return in the EU is 1 percent and hence you will have 10,100 in 2023. Rate of return in the US is about 0.62 percent: \\[\n10000\\text{€} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\$}{0.93 \\text{€}}\\cdot 1.02 \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{€}}{1.09 \\$}= 10062.1485 \\text{€}\n\\] Thus, it is better to invest in Europe.\nIn 2022 you have to pay 93 Cent for a dollar and in 2023 you expect to pay about 91 Cent for a dollar. Thus, you expect the Euro to appreciate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 18.2 Turkey vs. Germany\nYou have 100€ this year, \\(t-1\\), which you like to invest till next year, \\(t\\).\n\nWhere should you invest, given the following informations:\n\nThe interest rate in Germany is 1%.\nThe interest rate in Turkey is 10%.\n1€ can be converted to 7 ₺ this year in the FOREX\nYou expect that 1 € can be converted to 7.1 ₺ next year in the FOREX.\nYou expect no inflation in Germany and Turkey.\n\nCalculate the exchange rate in period t that makes investing in Germany and Turkey equal profitable.\nExplain why the Turkish Lira is under appreciation pressure in t-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTurkey vs. Germany (Exercise 18.2)\n\nWhen focusing solely on the interest rate, investing in Turkey appears more advantageous. However, if we consider only the development of the exchange rate, investing in Germany becomes more appealing due to the Euro appreciating relative to the Lira from period \\(t-1\\) to \\(t\\). Therefore, it’s essential to calculate the return on investment to determine which of the two effects predominates. This can be done in three different ways:\n(Exact) calculation method in four steps:\n 1. exchange € to ₺ in t-1:\n\\[\n100\\text{€}\\cdot E^{\\text{₺}/\\text{€}}_{t-1}= 100\\text{€} \\cdot 7\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}=700\\text{₺}\n\\] 2. invest in either Germany or Turkey: \\[GER \\rightarrow 100\\text{€}\\cdot (1+0.01)=101\\text{€}\\] \\[TUR\\rightarrow 700\\text{₺}\\cdot(1+0.1)=770\\text{₺}\\] 3. re-exchange  to : \\[770\\text{₺}\\cdot E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}}_{t}= 770\\text{₺}\\cdot\\frac{1 \\text{€}}{7\\frac{1}{10}\\text{₺}}=\\frac{7700}{71}\\approx 108.4507\\] 4. calculate the return on investment, \\(r\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\nr_{GER}=&0.01\\\\\nr_{TUR}=&\\frac{108.4507-100}{100}=0.084507\n\\end{align*}\\] Answer: The return on investment is lower in Germany. Thus, it is superior to invest the 100€ in Turkey.\n\n\n(Exact) Calculation method in one step: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overbrace{r}^{\\text{rate of return}}=& \\frac{I^{\\text{€}}_t-I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}}{I_{t-1}^{\\text{€}}}\n\\end{align*}\\] with \\(I^{\\text{€}}_{t}=\\overbrace{I^{\\text{€}}_{t-1}}^{\\text{investment in t-1}}\\cdot \\overbrace{E^{\\text{₺}/\\text{€}}_{t-1}}^{\\text{exchange rate in t-1}}\\cdot \\overbrace{(1+i)}^{1+ \\text{interest rate}}\\cdot \\overbrace{E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}}_{t}}^{\\text{exchange rate in t}}\\) \\[\\begin{align*}\nTUR\\rightarrow I_{t}^{\\text{€}}=&100\\text{€}\\cdot 7\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}\\cdot (1+0.1)\\cdot\\frac{1\\text{€}}{7.1\\text{₺}}=108.4507 \\rightarrow r_{TUR}=0.084507\\\\\nGER\\rightarrow I_{t}^{\\text{€}}=& 100\\text{€} \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1+0.01)\\cdot 1 = 101\\text{€}\\rightarrow r_{GER}=0.01\n\\end{align*}\\]\n(Approximative) calculation method: Steps a) to c) can be summarized as two rates of changes: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\underbrace{r'}_{\\text{approximative rate of return}}=&\\underbrace{i}_{\\text{interest rate}}+\\underbrace{w}_{\\text{rate of depreciation}}\\\\\n       \\text{with}\\quad    w=&\\frac{E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}}_{t}}{E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}}_{t-1}}-1\n\\end{align*}\\] \\[\\begin{align*}\n       r'_{GER}=&0.01\\\\\n       r'_{TUR}=&0.1+\\frac{\\frac{10}{71}}{\\frac{10}{70}}-1=0.1+\\frac{700}{710}-1=0.1-\\frac{10}{710}=\\frac{61}{710}\\approx 0.08591\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nBoth investments are equal profitable if \\[r_{GER}=r_{TUR}.\\] Given the information in period \\(t-1\\), the exact exchange rate in period \\(t\\) that makes investments are equal profitable, \\(E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*}_{t}\\), is calculated as follows: \\[\\begin{align*}\n          I^{\\text{€}}_{t}&=I^{\\text{€}}_{t-1} E^{\\text{₺}/\\text{€}}_{t-1} (1+i) E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺} *}_{t}\\\\\n          \\Leftrightarrow E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*}_{t}&= \\frac{I^{\\text{€}}_{t}}{(I^{\\text{€}}_{t-1} E^{\\text{₺}/\\text{€}}_{t-1} (1+i))}=\\frac{101}{(100\\cdot 7 \\cdot 1.1)}=\\frac{101}{770}\\approx 0.1311\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe approximate exchange rate in period \\(t\\) that makes investments are equal profitable, \\(E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*'}_{t}\\), is calculated as follows: \\[\\begin{align*}\nr_{GER}=&i_{TUR}+\\frac{E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*'}_{t}}{E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}}_{t-1}}-1\\\\\n            \\Leftrightarrow r_{GER}-i_{TUR}+1=&\\frac{E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*'}_{t}}{E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}}_{t-1}}\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*'}_{t}=& (r_{GER}-i_{TUR}+1)\\cdot E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}}_{t-1}\\\\\n            \\Leftrightarrow E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*'}_{t}=& (0.01-0.1+1)\\cdot \\frac{1}{7}=\\frac{91}{100}\\cdot \\frac{1}{7}=\\frac{91}{700}=0.13\n\\end{align*}\\] Let us proof our results by re-calculating the rate of return for an investment in Turkey with \\(E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*}_{t}\\) and \\(E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*'}_{t}\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\n            r'_{TUR}=&0.1+\\frac{\\frac{91}{700}}{\\frac{1}{7}}-1=\\frac{637}{700}-0.9=0.01\\\\\n            I_{t}^{\\text{€}*}=&100\\text{€}\\cdot 7\\frac{\\text{₺}}{\\text{€}}\\cdot (1+0.1)\\cdot \\frac{91}{700}\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}= \\frac{70070}{700}=100.1\\\\\n            \\rightarrow r_{TUR}^*=&0.01\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe ₺ must appreciate in t-1 since it is more profitable to exchange € to store the asset value in Turkey. That means the demand curve in the FOREX shifts upwards till the exchange rate equals the exchange rate that makes both investments equal profitable and hence nobody has an incentive to demand more ₺ for the given exchange rate \\(E^{\\text{€}/\\text{₺}*}_{t}\\) as calculated above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 18.3 Suppose you have 50,000 Indian Rupees (INR) this year that you want to invest for one year from \\(t\\) to \\(t+1\\) and then buy something with the Indian Rupees in India. Calculate the return on an investment in India and Germany, given the following conditions:\n\nThe annual interest rate in India is 5% and 2% in Germany.\n1 INR can be converted to 0.01 Euro (EUR) this year, \\(t\\).\n\nYou expect the Indian Rupee to depreciate, that is, you expect 1 EUR to cost 1 INR more next year, that is \\(t+1\\).\nMoreover, you expect no inflation in India and Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe return on investment for the investment in India is 5%.\nThe return on investment for the investment in Germany can be calculated as follows: \\[\n50,000 \\ \\text{INR} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{0.01 \\text{EUR}}{1 \\ \\text{INR}}}_{= \\frac{100 \\ \\text{INR}}{1 \\ \\text{EUR}}} \\cdot 1.02 \\cdot  \\frac{101 \\ \\text{INR}}{1 \\ \\text{EUR}}  = 51,510  \\ \\text{INR}\n\\] To calculate the rate of return calculate \\[\n\\frac{51,510-50,000}{50,000}\\cdot 100=3.02.\n\\] Thus, the return on investment for the investment in Germany is 3.02%. One challenge of this exercise is to consider “1 EUR to cost 1 INR more” properly. This does not mean 1 INR is equal to 1 €!",

    "section": "18.5 The theory in real markets: Unpegging the Swiss Franc",
    "text": "18.5 The theory in real markets: Unpegging the Swiss Franc\nYou might now question whether this theory of the interest parity condition truly holds in real-world markets. Analyzing international markets and the FOREX empirically is challenging due to the frequent occurrence of both large and small exogenous shocks on a global scale, each impacting market outcomes in various ways. Furthermore, market dynamics are often influenced by emotions and speculation rather than solely measurable facts. However, there are instances where the shocks are so significant that the fundamental forces driving the market become visible, even without a sophisticated empirical identification strategy that controls for confounding effects. The case study of the unexpected unpegging of the Swiss Franc serves as a poignant example. It vividly demonstrates that the principles underpinning the interest parity condition are not merely theoretical constructs but actively influence real market behaviors.\nUntil early 2015, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) had a policy goal to maintain the franc above the cap of 1.20 Francs per Euro, aiming to protect exporters and combat deflationary pressures. However, in a surprising move, the SNB unpegged the Franc in 2015. This decision was influenced by the appreciation pressure on the Franc, as many investors many investors wanted to store their assets in the Swiss Franc. Following the SNB’s announcement, the exchange rate plunged from 1.20 to 1.00 Franc per Euro \\((E^{\\frac{CHF}{\\text{€}}})\\), as illustrated in Figure 18.2 (a) Almost simultaneously, the interest rate experienced a decline, as depicted in Figure 18.2 (b). These developments align precisely with what the interest parity condition would predict, demonstrating its applicability in real-world financial market dynamics.\n\n\n\nFigure 18.2: The impact of unpegging the Franc on capital markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The exchange rate: \\(E^{\\frac{CHF}{\\text{€}}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Interest rate for investments in Switzerland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo analyze the relationship between changes in exchange rates and interest rates, we need to consider the interest parity assumption of Equation 18.8: \\[\nw= i-i^{*}\n\\] where \\[w=\\frac{E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}}{E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}}-1.\\] In January 2015, the exchange rate \\(E^{\\frac{CHF}{\\text{€}}}\\) decreased from 1.20 to 1.00. Alternatively, we can express this change in direct quotation, noting that the exchange rate \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}\\) increased from \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}_{t-1}\\approx \\frac{1}{1.20}\\approx 0.83\\) to \\(E^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}_{t}\\approx 1.00\\), resulting in \\[\n  w=\\frac{E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}}{E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{CHF}}}-1=\\frac{1}{0.83}-1=0.20.\n\\]\nSince \\(w &gt; 0\\), the fraction on the left-hand side of the interest rate parity equation must also be positive, as already mentioned. This implies that \\[i - i^* &gt; 0,\\] which means that an interest rate spread must occur. This condition can occur if the foreign interest rate \\(i^*\\) decreases or the domestic interest rate \\(i\\) increases. In our observations, we can indeed see a pattern that is consistent with our theoretical expectations.\nIt is important to acknowledge that our theoretical framework simplifies the complex interplay of factors that influence both exchange rates and interest rates. Despite this simplification, the model highlights the key forces driving market dynamics. However, it is important to point out that the actual numbers may not perfectly match our theoretical predictions in quantitative terms, as shown in Figure Figure 18.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 18.3: Short-term interest rates across Germany and Switzerland over time\n\n\n\nSource: Data are taken from the OECD and show the total, % per annum.",

    "section": "18.6 The Fisher Effect",
    "text": "18.6 The Fisher Effect\nThe Fisher Effect is an economic theory proposed by economist Irving Fisher (1867-1947), which describes the relationship between (expected) inflation and both nominal and real interest rates.\nAccording to the Fisher Effect, the nominal interest rate is equal to the sum of the real interest rate and the (expected) inflation rate. In formula terms, it is often expressed as: \\[\nr=i+\\pi.\n\\tag{18.9}\\]\nWe can derive Equation 18.9 assuming that the exchange rate is stable over time \\[\n\\left( E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}} =E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}} \\Leftrightarrow\n\\frac{E_{t-1}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}}{E_{t}^{\\frac{\\text{€}}{\\text{₺}}}}=1 \\Leftrightarrow \\alpha=1 \\right)\n\\] and using this in Equation 18.5, we get: \\[\\begin{align}\nr^*&= (1+i^{*})\\cdot  (1+\\pi^{*}) \\cdot \\underbrace{\\alpha}_{=1} -1  \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow r=&  i+ \\pi+ \\pi i\n\\end{align}\\] Assuming that the product \\(\\pi i\\) is very small, we can say that the rate of return equals approximately the interest rate plus the inflation rate. This approximation shown in Equation 18.9 is often called the Fisher Effect.\nConsidering now cross-country differences in their rate of return, we can explain the rate of return spread by the inflation rate and the nominal interest rate spread as follows: \\[r_{GER}-r_{TUR}= \\pi_{GER}-\\pi_{TUR} + i_{GER}-i_{TUR}. \\tag{18.10}\\]\nWe have learned in Section 18.4 (the interest parity condition) that the rate of return can differ only in the short run and will be equal across countries in the long run (\\(r_{GER} - r_{TUR} = 0\\)). Utilizing this concept in Equation 18.9, we can demonstrate that the nominal interest rates of countries will adjust to accommodate any changes in (expected) inflation, and vice versa:\n\\[i_{GER} - i_{TUR} = \\pi_{GER} - \\pi_{TUR}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended reading\n\n\n\nWikipedia (2025): Wikipedia entry to the Fisher Effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nWikipedia.

    "text": "19.2 The payments must be balanced!\nEvery international financial transaction is essentially an exchange. When a country sells goods or services, the buying country compensates by transferring assets. Consequently, the total value of goods and services a country sells (its net exports) must be equal to the value of assets it acquires (its net capital outflow).\nThe Balance of Payments account consists of two primary components:\n\nThe Current account (Leistungsbilanz) measures a country’s trade balance (goods and services exports minus imports) plus the effects of net income and direct payments. It is positive, if a country is a net lender to the rest of the world and negative, if it is a net borrower from the rest of the world. In other words, an account surplus increases a country’s net foreign assets.\nThe Capital account (Kapitalbilanz) reflects the net change in ownership of national assets. Capital can flow in the form of following:\n\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI): It involves investing in foreign companies with the intention of controlling or significantly influencing their operations.\nForeign Portfolio Investment (FPI): This type of investment is in foreign financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, where the investor does not seek control over the companies.\nOther investments: This includes capital flows into bank accounts or funds provided as loans. It also encompasses the reserve account, which is managed by the central bank responsible for buying and selling foreign currencies.\n\n\nIgnoring statistical effects, these two subaccounts must sum to zero. Table 19.1 shows you a hypothetical balance of payment account.\n\n\n\nTable 19.1: A hypothetical account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceipt (credit)\n\nPayments (debits)\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Account\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

This transaction increases exports (boosting net exports) and results in the United States acquiring foreign assets in the form of Yen (increasing net capital outflow).\nBoeing might then convert its Yen to U.S. Dollars through a financial exchange. For example, if an American mutual fund wants to invest in a Japanese company, Boeing’s sale of planes (a net export) is mirrored by the mutual fund’s investment in Japan (a net capital outflow).\nAlternatively, Boeing could exchange its Yen with an American company looking to purchase goods or services from Japan. In this scenario, the value of imports matches the value of exports, leaving net exports unchanged.\n\n\n\nWhile it’s true that the overall totals of payments and receipts must inherently balance, certain transaction types can create imbalances, leading to either deficits or surpluses. These imbalances may manifest in various sectors such as trade in goods (commodities), services trade, foreign investment income, unilateral transfers (including foreign aid), private investment, and the flow of gold and currency between central banks and treasuries, among other international dealings. It’s crucial to note, though, that the accounting framework ensures these surpluses and deficits ultimately zero out, adhering to the principles of double-entry bookkeeping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nTake, for example, a scenario where Americans purchase cars from Germany without engaging in any other transactions with it. The outcome is that Germans accumulate dollars, which can be maintained as bank deposits in the United States or within other U.S.-based assets. The American payment for German automobiles is counterbalanced by German acquisitions of dollar assets, including investments in U.S. entities and institutions. This exchange means Germany sells cars to the U.S., while the U.S. sells dollars or dollar-backed assets to Germany. Consequently, Germany experiences a trade surplus, indicated by a positive trade balance and a corresponding surplus in its current account, which encompasses the trade balance. Nonetheless, this also implies Germany faces a deficit in its capital account, characterized by a net outflow of money.",

    "text": "19.3 A normative discussion of imbalances in the capital and current account\nNormatively discussing imbalances in the capital and current accounts of countries involves evaluating these phenomena from a perspective of what ought to be, considering ethical, practical, and policy implications. These imbalances are not merely numerical figures; they reflect underlying economic activities and policy decisions with significant implications for national and global economic health.\n\n19.3.1 Current account imbalances\nThe current account includes trade in goods and services. A surplus in the current account indicates that a country is exporting more goods than it imports.\nSurpluses: Normatively, persistent current account surpluses might be viewed as a sign of a country’s competitive strength in the global market. However, they can also indicate underconsumption or insufficient domestic investment, suggesting that a country is not fully utilizing its economic resources to improve the living standards of its population. Furthermore, large surpluses can lead to tensions with trading partners and might prompt accusations of unfair trade practices or currency manipulation.\nDeficits: On the other hand, persistent deficits could signal domestic economic vitality and an attractive environment for investment, reflecting high consumer demand and robust growth. Yet, they can also indicate structural problems, such as a lack of competitiveness, reliance on foreign borrowing to sustain consumption, or inadequate savings rates. Over time, large deficits may lead to unsustainable debt levels, making the country vulnerable to financial crises.\n\n\n19.3.2 Capital account imbalances\nThe capital account records the net change in ownership of national assets. It includes the flow of capital into and out of a country, such as investments in real estate, stocks, bonds, and government debt.\nInflows: Capital account inflows can signify strong investor confidence in a country’s economic prospects, potentially leading to increased investment and growth. However, excessive short-term speculative inflows can destabilize the economy, leading to asset bubbles and subsequent financial crises when the capital is suddenly withdrawn.\nOutflows: Capital outflows might indicate a lack of confidence in the domestic economy or better opportunities abroad. While some level of outflow is normal for diversified investment portfolios, large and rapid outflows can precipitate a financial crisis by depleting foreign reserves and putting downward pressure on the currency.",

Given these components, the total economic output, \\(Y\\), can be expressed by the fundamental equation of economics as:\n\\[\nY = C + I + G.\n\\]\nThis equation encapsulates the aggregate spending within a closed economy, highlighting the interplay between consumption, investment, and government expenditure in determining overall economic activity.\nIf we define national savings, \\(S\\), as the share of output not spent on household consumption or government purchases, then the investments, \\(I\\), must be equal to the savings in a closed economy: \\[\\begin{align*}\nY &= C + I + G\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\underbrace{Y - C - G}_S &= I \\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow S &= I,\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThis implies that within a closed economy, any portion of the output that is not consumed—either privately by households (\\(C\\)) or by the government (\\(G\\))—necessarily must be allocated towards investment (\\(I\\)). Thus, the equation underscores a foundational economic principle: the total output of an economy (\\(Y\\)) is either consumed or invested, leaving no surplus output.\n\n\n19.4.2 Open economy\nIn an open economy, the dynamics of household consumption, government expenditures, and firm investments extend beyond domestic production to include imports from and exports to foreign markets. Thus, an economy can import and export goods. Denoting imports by \\(IM\\) and exports by \\(EX\\), we can re-write the fundamental equation of economics by adding the concept of net exports (\\(NEX\\)), the difference between a country’s exports and imports. A positive net export value (\\(EX &gt; IM\\)) indicates a trade surplus, reflecting that the economy exports more than it imports. Conversely, a negative net export value (\\(EX &lt; IM\\)) signifies a trade deficit, where imports exceed exports:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nY &= C + I + G + \\underbrace{EX - IM}_{NEX}\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\underbrace{Y - C - G}_S &= I + NEX\\\\\n\\Leftrightarrow \\underbrace{S-I}_{NCO} &= NEX\n\\end{align*}\\]\nIn scenarios where investment equals savings (\\(I = S\\)), the economy’s net exports are zero, reflecting a balance between domestic production not allocated towards household or government consumption and investments. However, when an economy experiences a trade surplus (\\(NEX &gt; 0\\)), such as Germany in recent decades, it implies that domestic savings exceed investments. This surplus indicates that the country produces more than it spends on domestic goods and services, channeling excess savings into investments abroad. Thus, savings not utilized domestically (\\(S - I\\)) are equivalent to the net capital outflow (\\(NCO\\)), establishing a direct link between a country’s trade surplus and its role as a global lender or investor:\n\\[\nNCO = NEX\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet exports must be equal to net capital outflow\nThe accounting identities above simply state that there is a balance of payments. The Balance of Payment accounts are based on double-entry bookkeeping and hence the annual account has to be balanced. If an economy has a current account trade deficit (surplus), it is offset one-to-one by a capital account surplus (deficit) to assure a balance of payments. In other words, if an economy wants to import more goods than it produces, it must attract foreign capital to be invested at home.",

    "text": "19.5 Case study: U.S. trade deficit\nConsider a scenario where the United States is unable to attract sufficient capital flows from abroad to finance its trade deficit. In such a case, American consumers continue purchasing foreign goods with US Dollars, leading to an outflow of US Dollars that surpasses inflow. This imbalance results in an increased supply of US Dollars relative to its demand, causing the value of the US Dollar to depreciate. A depreciated US Dollar would, in theory, make US exports more competitive (cheaper for foreign buyers) and imports more costly, thereby potentially reducing the current account deficit. However, the trade deficit of the United States has remained relatively stable, and the US Dollar has not experienced significant depreciation. This stability is partly why former President Trump criticized other countries for allegedly manipulating their currencies, see Figure 19.2.\nAs Trump thinks a trade deficit is bad for the United States, he would like to have a weak dollar and low interest rates. He advocated for a weaker dollar (I guess he would never express it like that) and lower interest rates to address this issue. A weaker dollar would render American products more affordable internationally, stimulating exports and discouraging imports. Concurrently, lower interest rates in the United States would diminish the country’s appeal for foreign capital investments (\\(I\\) would decrease), leading to reduced net capital inflows. This adjustment would, in turn, decrease the Capital Account surplus and, by extension, shrink the Current Account deficit. Specifically, Trump accused the Chinese government and the European Central Bank of implementing policies that undervalue their currencies (the Renminbi and the Euro), thereby gaining an unfair advantage in trade.\n\n\n\nFigure 19.2: Trump worries about the U.S. trade deficit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite significant efforts by President Trump to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, the endeavor did not achieve its intended outcome, as illustrated in Figure 19.3. One likely reason for this shortfall was the reduction of taxes for large corporations, which enhanced the rate of return on investments. This policy made investing in the U.S. more appealing to foreign investors, potentially counteracting efforts to diminish the trade deficit.\n\n\n\nFigure 19.3: The trade deficit of the United States over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 19.3 Discuss the pros and cons of Germany’s net export surplus.

Cengage Learning.\n\nYou have probably heard on the news that the Japanese are our competitors in the world economy. In some ways, this is true, for American and Japanese firms do produce many of the same goods. Ford and Toyota compete for the same customers in the market for automobiles. Compaq and Toshiba compete for the same customers in the market for personal computers.\nYet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries. Trade between the United States and Japan is not like a sports contest, where one side wins and the other side loses. In fact, the opposite is true: Trade between two countries can make each country better off.\nTo see why, consider how trade affects your family. When a member of your family looks for a job, he or she competes against members of other families who are looking for jobs. Families also compete against one another when they go shopping, because each family wants to buy the best goods at the lowest prices. So, in a sense, each family in the economy is competing with all other families.\nDespite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself from all other families. If it did, your family would need to grow its own food, make its own clothes, and build its own home. Clearly, your family gains much from its ability to trade with others. Trade allows each person to specialize in the activities he or she does best, whether it is farming, sewing, or home building. By trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower cost.\nCountries as well as families benefit from the ability to trade with one another. Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services. The Japanese, as well as the French and the Egyptians and the Brazilians, are as much our partners in the world economy as they are our competitors.",

    "text": "20.2 Reasons for Trade\nTrade involves willingly giving up something to receive something else in return, which should benefit both parties involved, although not necessarily everyone affected by the trade. We will discuss the negative effects of international trade on bystanders later. In this section, we briefly outline basic reasons for individuals and hence countries to engage in trade. Of course, the list is incomplete.\nDifferences in Technology: Advantageous trade can occur between countries if they have different technological abilities to produce goods and services. Technology refers to the techniques used to convert resources (labor, capital, land) into outputs. Differences in technology form the basis for trade in the Ricardian Model of comparative advantage. We will revisit this in more detail in Chapter 21.\nDifferences in Endowments: Trade also occurs because countries differ in their resource endowments, which include the skills and abilities of the workforce, available natural resources, and the sophistication of capital stock such as machinery, infrastructure, and communication systems. Differences in resource endowments are the basis for trade in the pure exchange models (see Section 20.3) and the Heckscher-Ohlin Model (see Chapter 22).\nDifferences in Demand: Trade between countries occurs because demands or preferences differ. Individuals in different countries may prefer different products even if prices are the same. For example, Asian populations might demand more rice, Czech and German people more beer, the Dutch more wooden shoes, and the Japanese more fish compared to Americans.\nEconomies of Scale in Production: Economies of scale, where production costs fall as production volume increases, can make trade between two countries advantageous. This concept, known as increasing returns to scale, plays a significant role in Paul Krugman’s New Trade Theory, which we will discuss later.\nExistence of Government Policies: Government tax and subsidy programs can create production advantages for certain products, leading to advantageous trade arising solely from differences in government policies across countries. We will explore the impact of tariffs and regulations in Chapter 25.",

Saylor Foundation. https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/276\n\n20.3.1 A simple barter model\nThe simplest example to show that trade can be beneficial to people is the barter model. In trade, barter is a system of exchange in which participants in a transaction directly exchange goods or services for other goods or services without using a medium of exchange, such as money.\n\n\n\nFigure 20.2: Stylized example of weißwürst and pretzels\n\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\n\nSuppose there are two people, Anton (A) and Barbara (B). Anton has 10 Weißwürste (white sausages) and Barbara has 10 pretzels. Together, they are isolated from the rest of the world for a few days due to a natural disaster. Fortunately, they both have additional access to an endless supply of sweet mustard and beer and they now wonder how to share pretzels and sausages the upcoming days. Let’s assume that both of them accept only a white sausage eaten together with a pretzel. That is, eating two pretzels with a sausage is no better than eating a pretzel and a sausage. After some discussion, Barbara gives 5 pretzels and Anton gives Barbara 5 sausages in return. They strongly believe that there is no better way to share food.\nThis example shows that trade can be beneficial for two individuals. Here we basically assume two things. Firstly, two individuals can trade and secondly, they are endowed with different goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 20.1 How Barbara and Anton trade\n\nVisualize the starting point of Anton and Barbara as described above in a two-way plot where the Anton’s initial endowment with sausages is drawn on the y-axis and Barbara’s endowment with pretzels is drawn on the x-axis.\nGiven their preferences, mark the consumption point after goods were traded. Also, draw in the plot how much Anton and Barbara exports and imports, respectively.\nSketch the indifference curve of both individuals in the consumption point after trade has happened.\nDraw a new two-way plot and assume that Barbara now gives away 2 pretzels in order to receive one sausage. Mark the resulting consumption points of Anton and Barbara. Given their unchanged preference for having one sausage with one slice of bread at best, visualize with the help of sketched indifference curves that both individuals are worse off as compared to consuming 5 units of pretzels and sausages each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 20.1. In Figure 20.3 you find a sketch of a solution to tasks a. to c. Figure 20.4 provides a solution to task d.\n\n\n\nFigure 20.3: The deal of Anton and Barbara\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.4: Indifference curves of Anton and Barbara\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.3.2 Terms of trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nThe terms of trade is defined as the quantity of one good that exchanges for a quantity of another. It is typical to express the terms of trade as a ratio.\n\n\nIn the example of Barbara and Anton, the exchange of goods occurs at a 1:1 ratio. In economics, this is referred to as the terms of trade being 1. The terms of trade are defined as the relative price of exports in relation to imports, or in other words, how much of one good can be exchanged for another. For instance, determining how many sausages can be exchanged for how many pretzels. The terms of trade, determined by the two trading partners, depend on a variety of distinct factors, including:\nPreferences: For trade to occur, each trader must desire something the other has and be willing to give up something of their own to obtain it. Formally, the expected utility of consuming some of Anton’s bread must exceed the disutility of foregoing a few of his sausages, and vice versa for Barbara. Typically, the goods are substitutable rather than perfectly complementary, as is assumed in our specific example.\nUncertainty: Both individuals have clear preferences. If Barbara has never tried Anton’s sausages, and Anton typically prefers bread over pretzels, offering free samples before an exchange could reduce uncertainty. Without a sample, their trade would be based on expectations about the taste of the other’s product.\nScarcity: The availability of the two goods influences the terms of trade. If, for instance, Barbara has 1000 pretzels, the terms of trade with the sausages would likely change.\nSize: The physical size of the goods can impact the terms of trade.\nQuality: The quality of goods affects the terms of trade. If the pretzels are stale and hard, both might prefer fewer pretzels per sausage.\nPersuasion: If Barbara is a more persuasive salesperson than Anton, she might be able to negotiate more favorable terms of trade.\nGovernment Policy: Taxes imposed by an official based on the traded quantities could affect the terms of trade. Additionally, if laws prevent Barbara and Anton from meeting, no trade would occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 20.2 Terms of trade\n\n\n\nFigure 20.5: Optimal consumption point\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you have a fixed income \\(I=10\\) that you can spend on consuming two substitutable goods \\(x, y\\) at certain prices \\(p_x=1, p_y=1\\). The current consumption decission is sketched in the figure above. Suppose the price of good \\(x\\) increases, that is, \\(p_x=2\\). Draw the new budget line. How will consumption change? What are the new terms of trade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new point of optimal consumption \\(OCP_1\\) at \\((x=2,y=6)\\) illustrates that an increase in the price of good \\(x\\) leads consumers to substitute good \\(x\\) and consume more of good \\(y\\) but less of good \\(x\\).\nThe terms of trade are now \\(\\frac{p_x}{p_y}=2\\). That is, consumers are willing to give up 1 unit of good \\(x\\) to receive 2 units of good \\(y\\). The budget line is drawn in blue.\n\n\n\nFigure 20.6: Optimal consumption point after price increase\n\n\n\nNote: The indifference curve \\(IC_1\\) in the graph is just a guess of mine because we don’t have preferences in form of a utility function given. For example, you can also draw an indifference curve that gives you the optimal consumption point at \\((x= 1;y= 8)\\) or \\((x= 4;y= 2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20.3.3 Endowments in an Exchange Economy\nIn this section, we examine a basic scenario where productive units within an economy are unable to adjust their output to recent changes in world market prices, which stem from global demand and supply fluctuations. Economists refer to the resulting availability of goods as endowments. Essentially, a country is endowed with a certain quantity of goods and seeks to trade these goods on global markets to maximize its welfare. In Chapter 22 we will assume that countries are endowed with a certain amount of factors of production that they can use to produce various goods.\n\n20.3.3.1 Fixed production\n\n\n\nFigure 20.7: Optimizing consumption through trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine that country H produces \\(\\bar{x}^H_1\\) units of good 1 and \\(\\bar{x}^H_2\\) units of good 2. In autarky (a state of where there is no trade), it consumes all the goods it produces. This scenario is shown in Figure 20.7, where point A represents the optimal welfare outcome with utility \\(W^H_A\\) for country H in autarky.\nNow, let’s assume country H can trade with the rest of the world at global market prices, where the price ratio of good 1 to good 2 in the world market, \\(( \\frac{p_1}{p_2} )_W\\), is greater than in autarky, \\(( \\frac{p_1}{p_2} )_A\\): \\[\\begin{align}\n\\left( \\frac{p_1}{p_2} \\right)_W &gt; \\left( \\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_A,\n\\end{align}\\]\nWith trade, country H can achieve a higher utility, \\(W_T^H&gt;W_A^H\\), by exporting good \\(x_1\\) and importing good \\(x_2\\), thus moving to a more advantageous consumption point.\n\n\n20.3.3.2 Flexible production\n\n\n\nFigure 20.8: Optimizing consumption by adjusting production and trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade is even more beneficial to a country if it can adjust its production to export more goods that are relatively high priced in the world market. This statement is shown in Figure 20.8.\nIn autarky, optimal consumption would be at point A and optimal consumption would be at point C under free trade. Now suppose that producers in country H know that they can sell their goods at price \\(p_1^W\\) and \\(p_2^W\\) before deciding what to produce. Then they would choose production point B on the production frontier curve to export good \\(x_1\\) and import good \\(x_2\\) at price \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_A\\) to be consumed at point D. Welfare at point D is higher than at point C or A because we end up at the highest indifference curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 20.3 Production and consumption\n\n\n\nFigure 20.9: Optimizing consumption by adjusting production and trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 20.9 the production possibility frontier curve, \\(PPF\\), of a country, \\(H\\), in autarky in which only two products, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), can be produced and consumed, respectively.\n\nGiven the country is in autarky (that is, no trade), the price relation of both goods within the country is represented by the line denoted with \\(P_{autarky}\\). The indifference curve that represents the utility maximizing level of utility is denoted with \\(IC_{autarky}\\). Mark in the figure how much of both goods are produced and consumed, respectively.\n\nSuppose country \\(H\\) opens up to trade with foreign countries. Further assume that the country can trade with other countries at fixed world market prices\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_W&gt;\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_A,\n\\end{align}\\] where \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_A\\) denotes the price relation of country H in autarky, \\(P_{autarky}\\). Sketch the world market price relation in the figure and mark the new production point on the production possibility frontier curve. Moreover, mark below those statements that are true:\nCountry \\(H\\) will produce more of good \\(x_1\\) than in autarky\nCountry \\(H\\) will produce more of good \\(x_2\\) than in autarky\nCountry \\(H\\) will consume more of good \\(x_1\\) than in autarky\nCountry \\(H\\) will export good \\(x_1\\) and import good \\(x_2\\).\nCountry \\(H\\) will export good \\(x_2\\) and import good \\(x_1\\).\nCountry \\(H\\) will suffer a loss of welfare due to opening up to trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 20.4 Production and consumption\nShow that opening markets to foreign trade can be beneficial for a small economy where only two goods can be produced and consumed. Use a two-way diagram to do this. In particular, show the consumption and production point of the economy in autarky with the corresponding price relation. Then assume that the economy opens up to the foreign market, allowing it to buy goods at world prices that are different from prices in autarky. Show the consumption and production point of the autarkic economy with the corresponding price relation under free trade. Can you outline the higher level of welfare in free trade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAs visualized in Figure 20.10, the indifference curve under free trade lies above the IC under autarky. This reflects the higher utility level under free trade.\n\n\n\nFigure 20.10: Gains from trade",

    "text": "20.4 More trade is not necessarily good (immiserizing growth)\nSo far, I have implicitly assumed that the world market price is fixed and not changed by the entry of country H into the free trade market. When the latter is the case, economists speak of a small open economy (SOE). In general, a SOE is an economy that is so small that its policies do not change world prices.\nSuppose that country H is not an SOE. What would happen to world prices if country H offered a lot of good \\(x_1\\) to receive good \\(x_2\\)? Obviously, \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_W\\) would fall. In the worst case, country H is so large that \\[\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_W=\\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_2}\\right)_A.\\] This means that country H has no benefits from free trade.\nAssuming that a (large) country cannot opt out from free trade and that the exporting sector grows, there is a theoretical scenario called immiserizing growth that shows that free trade countries are worse off in the long run. This scenario is illustrated in Figure 20.11. The figure summarizes two periods. In the first period, country H produces at point B and consumes at point D, trading goods at world prices \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_W\\). Then country H grows in sector 1. This is shown in the new production possibility curve TK2. If country H were able to trade at the old world price, it would be able to consume at point F. Unfortunately, country H is not a SOE, and therefore world prices (from country H’s perspective) deteriorate to \\((\\frac{p_1}{p_2})_W^{'}\\). This has bad implications for country H, since its optimal consumption is now at point D’, which has lower welfare relative to point D. However, this is not an argument against trade, since the welfare at point D’ is still above the production possibility curve in autarky, TK1.\n\n\n\nFigure 20.11: Immiserizing growth",

    "text": "21.1 Defining absolute and comparative advantages\nDavid Ricardo (1772-1823), one of the most influential economists of his time, had a simple idea that had a major impact on how we think about trade. In Ricardo (1817), he argued that bilateral trade can be a positive-sum game for both countries, even if one country is less productive in all sectors, if each country specializes in what it can produce relatively best.\nHe introduced the theory of comparative advantage that is still an important corner stone of the modern theory of international trade1 The theory is also known as the Ricardian model. It refers to the ability of one party (an individual, a firm, or a country) to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another party. In other words, it is the ability to produce a product with the highest relative efficiency, given all other products that could be produced. In contrast, an absolute advantage is defined as the ability of one party to produce a particular good at a lower absolute cost than another party.\nAs shown in Figure 21.2, the concept of comparative advantage is quite simple. Two parties can increase their overall productivity by sharing the workload based on their respective comparative advantages. Once they have achieved this increase in productivity, they must agree on how to divide the resulting output. Of course, both parties must benefit compared to a scenario in which they work independently.\nA subject (country, household, individual, company) has an absolute advantage in the production of a good relative to another subject if it can produce the good at lower total costs or with higher productivity. Thus, absolute advantage compares productivity across subjects but within an item.\nA subject has a comparative advantage in the production of a good relative to another subject if it can produce that good at a lower opportunity cost relative to another subject.\nLet me explain the idea of the concept of comparative advantage with some examples:",

The first woman is young, strong and educated. The second is older, less agile and rather uneducated. Thus, the first woman is faster, better and more productive in all productive activities. So she has an absolute advantage in all areas. The second woman, in turn, has an absolute disadvantage in all areas. In some activities, the difference between the two is large; in others, it is small. The law of comparative advantage states that it is not in the interest of either of them to work in isolation: They can both benefit from specialization and exchange. If the two women divide the work, the younger woman should specialize in tasks where she is most productive (for example, fishing), while the older woman should focus on tasks where her productivity is only slightly lower (for example, cooking). Such an arrangement will increase overall production and benefit both.\n\n\nThe lawyer’s typist\nThe famous economist and Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson (1915-2009) provided another example in his well-received textbook of economics, as follows: Suppose that in a given city the best lawyer also happens to be the best secretary. However, if the lawyer focuses on the task of being a lawyer, and instead of practicing both professions at the same time, hires a secretary, both the lawyer’s and the secretary’s performance would increase because it is more difficult to be a lawyer than a secretary.2\n2 In the first eight editions the example comprised a male lawyer who was better at typing than his female secretary, but who had a comparative advantage in practising law. In the ninth edition published 1973, both lawyer and secretary were assumed to be female (see Backhouse & Cherrier, 2019). Unfortunately, women are still discriminated against in introductory economics textbooks (see Stevenson & Zlotnik, 2018).\nBackhouse, R. E., & Cherrier, B. (2019).

    "text": "21.2 Autarky: An example of two different persons\nAssume that A and B want to produce and consume \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) respectively. Because of the complementarity of the two goods, each must be consumed in combination with the other. The utility function of both persons is \\(U_{\\{A;B\\}}=min(x,y)\\). Both persons work for 4 time units, that is, their units of labor are \\(L_A=L_B=4\\). A needs 1 units of labor to produce one unit of good \\(y\\) and 2 units of labor to produce one unit of good \\(x\\). B needs \\(\\frac{4}{10}=0.4\\) units of labor to produce one unit of good \\(y\\) or good \\(x\\). Thus, their labor input coefficients, which measure the units of labor required by a subject to produce one unit of good, are \\(a^A_y=1, a^A_x=2, a^B_y=0.4, a^B_x=0.4\\):\n\n\n\ninput coefficient (\\(a\\))\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n1\n0.4\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n2\n0.4\n\n\n\nSpending all her time in the production of \\(y\\), A can produce \\(\\frac{L_A}{a_y^A}=\\frac{4}{1}=4\\) units of \\(y\\) and B can produce \\(\\frac{L_B}{a_y^B}=\\frac{4}{0.4}=10\\) units of \\(y\\). Spending all her time in the production of \\(y\\), A can produce \\(\\frac{L_A}{a_x^A}=\\frac{4}{2}=2\\) units of \\(x\\)and B can produce \\(\\frac{L_B}{a_x^B}=\\frac{4}{0.4}=10\\) units of \\(x\\). Knowing this, we can easily draw the production possibility frontier curves (PPF) of person A and B as shown in Figure 21.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 21.3: The production possibility frontier in autarky\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn autarky, both person maximize their utility: Individual A can consume \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) units of each good and individual B can consume \\(5\\) units of each good. The respective indifference curves are drawn in dashed blue lines in Figure 21.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 21.1 Indifference curves for perfect complementary goods\n\nName some real world examples of goods that are perfectly complementary.\nThe blue dashed lines in Figure 21.3 represent the indifference curves of individual A and B. The upward sloping dashed black line is denoted with ``possible consumption path’’. Explain, why is it not correct–in strict sense–to name it like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.1 Can person A and B improve their maximum consumption with cooperation?\nLet us assume the two persons come together and try to understand how they can improve by jointly deciding which goods they should produce. If we assume that both persons redistribute their joint production so that both have an incentive to share and trade, we can concentrate on the total production output. Their joint PPF curve can then be drawn in two ways:\n\nPerson A specializes in good \\(x\\), then the joint production possibilities are presented in Figure 21.4.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.4: World PFF, A specializes in \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf A produces only good \\(x\\), as shown in Figure 21.4, we see that A and B can consume a total of 6 units of goods \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This is less in total than in autarky, where A can consume \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) units of each good and person B can consume \\(5\\) units of each good, giving a combined consumption of \\(\\frac{19}{3}=6,\\bar{6}\\).\n\nPerson A specializes in good \\(y\\), then the joint production possibilities are presented in Figure 21.5.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.5: World PFF, A specializes \\(y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf A produces only good \\(y\\), as shown in Figure 21.5, we see that A and B can consume a total of 7 units of goods \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Thus, both can be better off compared to autarky, since the total quantity distributed is larger. Thus, we have an Pareto improvement here because at least one person can be better off compared to autarky.\n\n\n\nFigure 21.6: World PFF in autarky when A specialize in producing good \\(y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 21.6, the three possible consumption scenarios are marked with a dot and the PPFs of person A specializing in the production of good \\(x\\) (\\(PPF_{A\\rightarrow x}\\)) or good \\(y\\) (\\(PPF_{A\\rightarrow y}\\)) are also drawn. The scenario with person A specializing in the production of good \\(y\\) is the output maximizing solution.\n\n\n21.2.2 Optimal production in cooperation\nIn order to produce the most bundles of both goods, the optimal cooperative production is\n\n\n\nproduction in cooperation\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n4\n3\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n0\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.3 Check for absolute advantage\nEmploying 10 units of labor B can produce more of both goods and hence has an absolute advantage in producing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Formally, we can proof this by comparing the input coefficients of both countries in each good:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nabsolute advantage\nA\n\nB\n\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n\\(a_y^A=1\\)\n&gt;\n\\(0.4=a_y^B\\)\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) B has an absolute advantage in good \\(y\\)\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n\\(a_x^A=2\\)\n&gt;\n\\(0.4=a_x^B\\)\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) B has an absolute advantage in good \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.4 Check for comparative advantage\nThe slope of the PPFs represent the marginal rate of transformation, the terms of trade in autarky and the opportunity costs of a country. The opportunity costs are defined by how much of a good \\(x\\) (or \\(y\\)) a person (or country) has to give up to get one more of good \\(y\\) (or \\(x\\)). For example, A must give up \\(\\frac{a_x^A}{a_y^A}=\\frac{1}{2}=0.5\\) of good \\(x\\) to produce one more of good \\(y\\). Thus, A’s opportunity costs of producing one unit of \\(y\\) is the production foregone, that is, a half good \\(x\\). All opportunity costs of our example are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopportunity costs of producing …\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\n…1 unit of good \\(y\\):\n\\(\\frac{a_y^A}{a_x^A}=\\frac{1}{2}=0.5\\) (good x)\n\\(\\frac{a_y^B}{a_x^B}=\\frac{0.4}{0.4}=1\\) (good x)\n\n\n…1 unit of good \\(x\\):\n\\(\\frac{a_x^A}{a_y^A}=\\frac{2}{1}=2\\) (good y)\n\\(\\frac{a_x^B}{a_y^B}=\\frac{0.4}{0.4}=1\\) (good y)\n\n\n\nPerson A has a comparative advantage in producing good \\(y\\) since A must give up less of good \\(x\\) to produce one unit more of good \\(y\\) than person B must. In turn, Person B has a comparative advantage in producing good \\(x\\) since B must give up less of good \\(y\\) to produce one unit more of good \\(x\\) than person B must give up of good \\(y\\) to produce one unit more of good \\(x\\). Thus, every person has a comparative advantage and if both would specialize in producing the good in which they have a comparative advantage and share their output they can improve their overall output as was shown in Figure 21.6.\nAn alternative and more direct way to see the comparative advantages of A and B, respectively, is by comparing the two input coefficients of A with the two input coefficients of B: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} &\\lesseqqgtr \\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \\quad  \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{2} &lt;\\frac{0.4}{0.4}.\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, A has a comparative advantage in \\(y\\) and B in \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparative advantage: Definition\nEconomic subjects (e.g., individuals, households, firms, countries) should specialize in the production of that good in which they have a comparative advantage, that is, the ability of an economic subject to carry out a particular economic activity (e.g., producing goods) at a lower opportunity cost than a trade partner.\n\n\\(\\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} &gt; \\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \\Rightarrow\\) country A (B) has a comparative advantage in good x (y)\n\\(\\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} &lt; \\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \\Rightarrow\\) country A (B) has a comparative advantage in good y (x)\n\\(\\frac{a^A_y}{a^A_x} = \\frac{a^B_y}{a^B_x} \\Rightarrow\\) no country has a comparative advantage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.2.5 Trade structure and consumption in cooperation\nIf A specializes in the production of \\(y\\), she must import some of good \\(y\\), otherwise she cannot consume a bundle of both goods as desired. In turn, B wants to import some of the good \\(y\\). B will not accept to consume less than 5 bundles of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) as this was his autarky consumption. Thus, B wants a minimum of 2 units of good \\(y\\) from A. A will not accept to give more than \\(4-\\frac{4}{3}=2\\frac{2}{3}\\) items of good \\(y\\) away and he wants at least \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\) items of good \\(x\\). Overall, we can define three trade scenarios:\n\nAll gains from cooperation goes to A (see Figure 21.7 and Table 21.1);\nAll gains from cooperation goes to B (see Table 21.2); or\nThe gains from specialization and trade are shared by A and B with a trade structure between the two extreme scenarios.\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.1: : Consumption and trade when all gains from cooperation goes to A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n2\n5\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n2\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Exports and imports of goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n-2\n2\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n2\n-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.2: : Consumption and trade when all gains from cooperation goes to B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\\(5\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\\(5\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Exports and imports of goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\nGood \\(y\\)\n\\(-\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)\n\n\nGood \\(x\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\\(-\\frac{4}{3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the three cases yield a Pareto-improvement, that is, none gets worst but at least one gets better by mutually decide on production and redistribute the joint output. In the real world, however, it is often difficult for countries to cooperate and decide mutually on production and consumption. In particular, it is practically difficult to enforce redistribution of the joint outcome so that everyone is better off. So let’s examine whether there is a mechanism that yields trade gains for both trading partners.\n\n\n\nFigure 21.7: Bilateral trade with one winner",

    "section": "21.4 Distribution of welfare gains",
    "text": "21.4 Distribution of welfare gains\nThe Ricardo theorem tells us nothing about the precise distribution of welfare gains. In this section, I will show that the distribution of welfare gains is the result of relative supply and demand in the world.\nTo illustrate this, consider Ricardo’s famous example4 of two countries (England and Portugal) that can produce cloth \\(T\\) and wine \\(W\\) with different input requirements, namely:\n4 The example is explained by Suranovic (2012) in greater detail.\nSuranovic, S. (2012). International economics: Theory and policy (1.0 ed.). Saylor Foundation. https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/276\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{p^P_W}{p^P_T}=\\frac{a^P_W}{a^P_T}=\\frac{8}{9}&lt;\\frac{12}{10}=\\frac{a^E_W}{a^E_T}= \\frac{p^E_W}{p^E_T}\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, England has an absolute disadvantage in the production of both goods, but England has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth and Portugal has a comparative advantage in the production of wine. Let us further assume that both countries are similarly endowed with labor, \\(\\bar{L}\\). Then we can calculate the world supply of cloth and wine given relative world prices, \\(\\frac{p_T}{p_W}\\). Since we know that Portugal will only produce wine if the price of wine relative to cloth is above \\(\\frac{p_W}{p_T}=\\frac{8}{9}\\) and England will only produce wine if the price of wine relative to cloth is above \\(\\frac{p_W}{p_T}=\\frac{12}{10}\\), we can draw the relative world supply of goods as shown in the left panel of Figure 21.8. Note that \\(\\alpha\\) in the figure means \\(\\frac{1}{a}\\). Similarly, we can draw in the world supply of clothes, shown in the left panel of Figure 21.8.\n\n\n\nFigure 21.8: World’s relative supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether both countries specialize totally in the production of one good, or only one country does so depends on world demand for both goods at relative prices. Since we know from the Ricardo Theorem that the world market price relation, \\(\\frac{p^{*}_T}{p^{*}_W}\\), must be between the two autarky price relations: \\[\\begin{align}\n    \\frac{p^P_T}{p^P_W}&gt;\\frac{p^{*}_T}{p^{*}_W}&gt; \\frac{p^E_T}{p^E_W}.\n\\end{align}\\] If world demand for cloth would be sufficiently high to have a world price of \\[\\frac{p^P_T}{p^P_W}=\\frac{9}{8}\\] Portugal would not gain from trade. On the contrary, if world demand for wine would be sufficiently high to have a world price of \\[\\frac{p^P_T}{p^P_W}=\\frac{10}{12}\\] England would not gain from trade. Thus, the price span between \\(\\frac{10}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{9}{8}\\) says us which country gains from trade. For example, at a world price of \\[\\frac{p^{*}_T}{p^{*}_W}=1\\] about 57%\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\left[\\frac{\\left(1-\\frac{10}{12}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{9}{8}-\\frac{10}{12}\\right)}\\approx 0.57 \\right]\n\\end{align}\\] of the gains through trade will be distributed to Portugal and about 43% will be distributed to England.\nIn Figure 21.9, I show two demand curves of the World. The dashed demand curve represents a world with a relative strong preference on wine and the other demand curve represents a relative strong demand for cloth. Since Portugal has a comparative advantage in producing wine, they would happy to live in a world where demand for wine is relatively high, whereas the opposite holds true for England.\n\n\n\nFigure 21.9: World’s relative supply and demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 21.2 Comparative advantage and opportunity costs\nAssume that only two countries, A and B, exist.

Both countries are equally endowed with labor which is the only production factor. Both countries can produce either good \\(y\\) or good \\(x\\). The table below gives the input coefficients, \\(a\\), for both countries, that is, the units of labor needed to produce one unit of good \\(y\\) and good \\(x\\), respectively.\n\n\n\nGood\nCountry A\nCountry B\n\n\n\n\nGood y\n10\n9\n\n\nGood x\n12\n10\n\n\n\nDiscuss absolute and comparative advantages. How much faster does B needs to in producing good \\(y\\) to become an exporter of that good?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe logic of opportunity cost is straightforward. You must compare the opportunity costs across countries: If country A wants to produce one more unit of good \\(y\\), it requires 10 units of labor. With these 10 units, it could produce 10/12 = 0.83 units of good \\(x\\) because it requires 12 units of labor to produce 1 unit of good \\(x\\). If country B wants to produce one more unit of good \\(y\\), it requires 9 units of labor. With these 9 units, it could produce 9/10 = 0.9 units of good \\(x\\) because it requires 10 units of labor to produce 1 unit of good \\(x\\). Thus, the opportunity costs of country A are smaller compared to country B in producing good \\(y\\).

    "text": "22.1 Nobel prize winning theory\nThe theory which we discuss in this section explains trade because of different endowments. It is also known as the Heckscher-Ohlin model. It is named after two Swedish economist, Eli Heckscher (1879-1952) and Bertil Ohlin (1899-1979). Bertil Ohlin received the Nobel Prize in 1977 (together with James Meade). The HO-Model, as it is often abbreviated, was the main reason for the price. Here is an excerpt of the Award ceremony speech:\nThe Ricardo model explains international trade as advantageous because of comparative advantages that are the result of technological differences. This means that comparative advantage in the Ricardian model is solely the result of productivity differences. The size of a country or the size of the countries’ endowments does not matter for comparative advantage in the Ricardian model because there is only one factor of production in Ricardian models, namely labor. However, the assumption that there is only one factor of production is unrealistic, and we should ask what happens if there is more than one factor of production but no productivity differences? What happens if the two factors are available differently in different countries? What is the significance of endowment differences for international trade? And which owner of a factor of production will be a winner when a country opens up to world trade, and who will lose? The HO model can provide answers to these questions.\nIn Table 22.1, I show that countries do indeed differ substantially in their total factor productivity, capital stock, and labor endowments, which are likely correlated with total population.\nSource: Penn World Tables 9.0",

    "text": "Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\n\nThe question why individuals, firms and nations exchange goods and services with each other, and how these processes are influenced by government policies, may be regarded as the basic issue in the science of economics. In the case of exchange between countries, the dominating theory was for a long time – from the beginning of the 19th century – David Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. Ricardo explained there the structure of foreign trade by differences in the production technology between nations. Over the years the theory was gradually improved upon in various ways, but a more basic overhaul did not take place until Bertil Ohlin in the early 1930’s published his work Interregional and International Trade, which is now a classic, and James Meade in the 1950’s came out with his important volumes on The Theory of International Economic Policy.\nBertil Ohlin showed in this work, which to some extent was inspired by a remarkable article by Eli Heckscher, that foreign trade may arise even if the production technology were identical in different nations. It is enough that the supplies of the factors of production of various kinds – such as labor of different types, capital, and land – differ among nations. The starting point of Ohlin’s theory is that a country tends to be an exporter of commodities that use relatively large amounts of the factors of production which are in ample supply as compared to domestic demand – in the hypothetical case without foreign trade. For instance, to take a simple example, if land is abundant in Australia while labor is relatively plentiful in England, we would expect Australia to be an exporter of commodities which for their production require much land, such as wool, while England would be an exporter of commodities the production of which requires relatively much labor, such as textiles.\nFrom this simple theoretical structure, the so-called Heckscher-Ohlin model, follow a number of interesting theorems. One of them, the factor price equalization theorem, tells us that foreign trade tends to equalize the prices of the factors of production in different countries. For instance, when Australia starts to export land-intensive goods, the demand for land goes up relative to labor, with a rise in land prices as a result, while the export of labor-intensive goods by England pulls up wages there relative to the price of land. Thus, trade in commodities tends to have the same effects on the prices of the factors of production as if the factors themselves could move freely between countries. In this sense, commodity trade is a substitute for international mobility of the factors of production. Another inference from Ohlin’s theory is that a tariff on a labor-intensive good, such as textiles, affects the distribution of income in favor of labor in the importing country, while a tariff on a capital-intensive commodity, such as wool or steel, results in an income redistribution in favor of the owner of capital.\nSource: www.nobelprize.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 22.1: Endowment differences across countries in 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegionCode\nCapital stock at current PPPs (in mil. 2011USD)\nPopulation (in millions)\nCapital stock per capita\n\n\n\n\nITA\n10421041\n60\n174885\n\n\nESP\n7806612\n47\n167518\n\n\nFRA\n10405968\n65\n160395\n\n\nGBR\n9973122\n63\n159019\n\n\nDEU\n12687682\n80\n157738\n\n\nUSA\n48876336\n310\n157729\n\n\nAUS\n3332890\n22\n150382\n\n\nCAN\n5065392\n34\n148431\n\n\nJPN\n17161376\n127\n134790\n\n\nSAU\n3716382\n28\n132300\n\n\nKOR\n6052155\n49\n123287\n\n\nTWN\n2835890\n23\n122549\n\n\nROU\n1271652\n20\n62647\n\n\nVEN\n1765996\n29\n60905\n\n\nBRA\n9869311\n199\n49691\n\n\nRUS\n6746460\n143\n47126\n\n\nPOL\n1769004\n39\n45859\n\n\nTHA\n2977965\n67\n44652\n\n\nIRN\n3234132\n74\n43555\n\n\nARG\n1773984\n41\n43034\n\n\nMEX\n5054693\n119\n42613\n\n\nTUR\n2938288\n72\n40634\n\n\nUKR\n1616826\n46\n35420\n\n\nIDN\n8146254\n242\n33716\n\n\nCOL\n1446480\n46\n31501\n\n\nCHN\n42218080\n1341\n31483\n\n\nPER\n681036\n29\n23185\n\n\nPHL\n1560017\n93\n16767\n\n\nIRQ\n443733\n31\n14375\n\n\nIND\n15356803\n1231\n12475",

Variables referring to foreign countries are marked with an asterisk, \\(*\\).\nTwo goods: \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nTwo factors of production: \\(K\\) and \\(L\\). This is new in relation to the Ricarkian model! Let’s name the factors \\(K\\) and \\(L\\), which stands for capital and labor.\nGoods differ in terms of their need for factors of production: \\[\\frac{K_y}{L_y} \\neq \\frac{K_x}{L_x}.\\] This means that one good must be produced in a capital-intensive way and the other in a labor-intensive way. If we assume that good \\(y\\) is capital intensive and good \\(x\\) is labor intensive in production, we can write: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{K_y}{L_y} &gt; \\frac{K_x}{L_x}.\n\\end{align*}\\] In this inequality, the quantity of capital required to produce good \\(y\\), \\(K_y\\), is on the left-hand side relative to the quantity of labor required to produce good \\(y\\), \\(L_y\\), that is, the capital intensity of good \\(y\\).The capital intensity of good \\(x\\) is on the right-hand side of the inequality. Rewriting this inequality, we can express it in terms of labor intensities: \\(\\frac{L_y}{K_y} &lt; \\frac{L_x}{K_x}.\\) It should be clear that both inequalities say the same thing.\nNo technology differences between countries: Since we already know from Ricardian theory that productivity or technology differences are a source of international trade, we do not want to explain the same thing again with the HO model. So we assume that all input coefficients are the same in all countries.\nDifferent relative factor endowments: \\[\\frac{K}{L} \\neq \\frac{K^*}{L^*}.\\] Since countries are assumed to have different factor endowments, the model links a country’s trade pattern to its endowment of factors of production. The capital-labor ratio in the home country, \\(\\frac{K}{L}\\), must differ from the ratio abroad. Suppose the home country is capital-rich and the foreign country is labor-rich. Then we have the following ratios between capital and labor in the two countries: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{K}{L} &gt; \\frac{K^*}{L^*}.\n\\end{align*}\\] This means that the capital-labor ratio (a country’s capital intensity) is higher in the home country than abroad. In terms of the ratio between labor and capital, that is, the labor intensity of a country, this can be expressed as follows: \\(\\frac{L}{K} &lt; \\frac{L^*}{K^*}.\\) It should be clear that both inequalities say the same thing.\nFree factor movement between sectors Both factors can be used in the production of both goods. Note that cross-country movement of factors (migration, foreign direct investment) is not allowed.\nNo trade costs Final products can be traded without any costs.\nEqual tastes in countries and homothetic preferences Consumers in both countries have the same utility function. Homothetic preferences simply mean that for given relative prices, income does not affect the ratio of consumption.",

Demand for the scarce resource will also increase, but to a lesser extent.\nIf production of the good that intensively uses the scarce resource decreases, both abundant and scarce resources will be released, but relatively more of the scarce resource than of the abundant resource.\nIn autarky, the relatively scarce factor in the home country was labor and factor prices were as follows: \\[\n      \\frac{w}{r}&gt;\\frac{w^*}{r^*}\n\\]\nAfter opening to trade, production shifts to the home country so that the wage falls (\\(w\\downarrow\\)) and the rent rises (\\(r\\uparrow\\)).\nAfter opening to trade, production shifts abroad so that the wage rises, \\(w^*\\uparrow\\), and the rent falls, \\(w^*\\downarrow\\).\nThis reallocation process, and hence the change in factor prices, continues until factor prices are equal in all countries: \\[\n      \\frac{w}{r}=\\frac{w^*}{r^*}\n\\]\n\nFigure 22.1 visualizes the reasoning behind the factor-price equalization theorem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor-price equalization theorem\n\n\n\nThe prices of the two factors of production (wage and rent) will be equalized across countries as a result of international trade in goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.1: HO Model and factor prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI recommend a clip of Mike Moore explaining how trade based on factor endowments affects wages and returns to capital, see this video:\n\n\n\nWhy does the Factor-Price Equalization Theorem not (fully) hold?\nIn the real world, factor prices do not equalize due to frictions such as transportation costs, trade barriers, and the presence of goods that are rarely or never traded.\nTrade as an alternative to factor movements:\nThe factor price equalization theorem contains an interesting insight: if a country allows free trade in its products, it will automatically export the abundant factor indirectly in the form of goods that intensively use the abundant factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 22.1 Ricardo and Heckscher-Ohlin\n\nDiscuss the main differences of the Ricardian Model and the Heckscher-Ohlin Model.\nAssume that only two countries, A and B, exist.

Autarky equilibria are marked with \\(A^{A}\\) and \\(A^{B}\\), respectively. The production points in trade equilibrium are marked with \\(P^A\\) and \\(P^B\\), the consumption point of both countries is in \\(C^A=C^B\\). Thus, production and consumption points are divergent. The indifference curve under free trade is clearly above the other indifference curve in autarky. The solid black line that is tangient to the consumption point under free trade represents the utility maximizing world market price under free trade.

    "text": "23.1 Assumptions\nFrom the Ricardian model, we know that trade is a positive-sum game. If free trade is beneficial to a country, as Ricardo predicts, why isn’t everyone happy with free trade? In democratic societies, policymakers sometimes adopt protectionist trade policies because of pressure from interest groups and public demand. The discrepancy between the promises and potential benefits of trade on the one hand and the negative consequences of free trade for many groups on the other is illustrated in Figure 23.1. The models so far do not give us a way to see which groups actually suffer from free trade, and thus we have no clue why there are incentives for interest groups to oppose free trade. Are anti-free trade policy preferences the result of ignorance, general worldviews, political ideology, environmental attitudes, social trust, or other factors? Well, these things may play a role, but there are also economic factors, that is, the self-interest of individuals and groups within an economy, that can account for anti-free trade attitudes. In the following sections, we will discuss a theory that shows that while free trade benefits countries as a whole, not everyone within a country benefits equally. Some benefit more than others, and some are actually made worse off by free trade.\nIn the next two subsections, we derive some key hypotheses that free trade favors those people in a country who have abundant factors of production and disadvantages those who have scarce factors. Moreover, free trade favors investors and workers in export-oriented industries with comparative advantages.\nThe sector-specific model, also known as the Ricard-Viner model, can show that there are winners and losers in international trade. The model is based on the following assumptions:",

The Dispute Settlement Body is a meeting of the WTO General Council that brings together all representatives of WTO member governments, usually at the ambassador level. Any WTO member that believes another member is in violation of an obligation or WTO rule can file a complaint. The goal of the Dispute Settlement Body is then to find a solution to the dispute, including any violation. The first step is consultations between governments. If the dispute cannot be resolved through discussions, the DSB makes a decision and the offending country is ordered to correct its policies. In most cases, countries find a mutually acceptable solution to the dispute. If the offending country does not correct its policy or provide other compensation, the WTO authorizes retaliatory action by the complaining country against the offending country. The adjudication process can take some time, as can the implementation of remedies to enforce or compensate for the violation of a WTO rule.

However, this high rate of US participation as respondent to complaints on trade violations is still much lower than its share in suspension requests. In the years I reviewed, there were 75 complainants that prevailed over the US. These are the cases where there is a potential for suspension requests in case of non-compliance. Indeed, 26 of these complainants ended up submitting suspension request against the US. That corresponds to 34.6% of the total.

NextGeneration:AI\nGlobalization is a multifaceted concept that refers to the increasing interconnectedness and interdependence of countries and cultures around the world. When people use the term “globalization,” they often mean several interrelated processes:\nEconomic Globalization: This aspect emphasizes the integration of national economies through trade, investment, and capital flows. It involves the reduction of trade barriers, the rise of multinational corporations, and the spread of global supply chains. Economic globalization has led to increased access to goods, services, and jobs across borders.\nCultural Globalization: This involves the sharing and blending of cultural elements such as language, traditions, music, and values. Through media, travel, and technology, cultural practices and ideas can spread more freely, leading to both cultural exchange and homogenization. It raises discussions around the preservation of local cultures versus the influence of dominant global cultures.\nPolitical Globalization: This refers to the increasing influence of international institutions and agreements, such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and trade treaties. It encompasses the idea of global governance and the shared responsibility of nations to address global challenges like climate change, human rights, and security.\nTechnological Globalization: This highlights the role of technology in fostering globalization. Advances in communication, transportation, and information technology have made it easier for people and businesses to connect globally. The internet, for example, enables instantaneous communication and the transfer of information across borders.\nSocial Globalization: This aspect focuses on the movements of people around the world, including migration, tourism, and the exchange of ideas and social practices. It emphasizes how global interactions affect societal structures and relationships.\nEnvironmental Globalization: This addresses the global nature of environmental issues, such as climate change and biodiversity loss, which require international collaboration and efforts to manage resources sustainably.\nCritically, globalization is also a subject of debate and contention. Advocates argue that it can lead to economic growth, cultural exchange, and improved living standards. Critics, however, point to issues such as economic inequality, cultural erosion, and exploitation as consequences of globalization. Additionally, events like the COVID-19 pandemic have sparked discussions about the vulnerabilities and risks associated with a highly interconnected world.\nOverall, globalization encompasses a broad range of interactions and dependencies that shape contemporary society, economy, and culture on a global scale.",

    "section": "25.2 Political arguments for trade restrictions",
    "text": "25.2 Political arguments for trade restrictions\nLike most things in real life, trade is never all good or all evil. There are arguments in favor of opening up foreign markets and promoting international cooperation, but there are also plausible arguments that justify restricting international trade. Very often it is an empirical question as to which line of argumentation dominates.\nWhen politicians and interest groups debate the pros and cons of trade, we must be aware of the unfortunate circumstance that not everything that is plausible is logically correct or empirically dominant. Below I will discuss some plausible arguments in favor of trade restrictions. The list is incomplete. Each argument is a topic in itself, and it needs to be further investigated whether these arguments are really valid arguments in favor of trade restrictions.\n\n25.2.1 The desire to reduce domestic unemployment\nAs we learned in the previous sections, the domestic production is the result of the world market price in the long-run. However, in the short run this means that production factors need to reallocate from one sector to the other. So far, we assumed that this reallocation happens without any frictions. Thus, we just moved along the PPF curve. In reality the transformation process is costly because the people loose their jobs without finding a job in another sector instantaneously without any costs. In reality a transformation process comes along with costs such as social costs and search and matching costs. Thus, it can be a rational strategy to decrease the reallocation/transformation pressure in order to organize the reallocation of productions factors properly holding the external negative effects of transformation low. Nevertheless, we should not forget that (in the long run) reallocation of production factors and the adaption of new technologies is basically one of the most important sources of welfare growth, if not the only source.\n\n\n25.2.2 The key enabling technology argument\nIf domestic industries are fostered, there might be technological spillovers to other industries in the country. As the government internalizes these spillovers, they have an incentive to protect and support these key to growth industries and technologies, respectively.\n\n\n25.2.3 The need to counteract dumping in international trade\nSelling goods in a foreign market below the price charged domestically can be called dumping. This sort of price competition is harmful when foreign producers hamper competition and discourage innovation and upgrading. For example, predatory dumping can give arguments for anti-dumping policy interventions. Predatory dumping is a type of anti-competitive behavior in which a foreign company prices its products below market value in an attempt to drive out domestic competition. This may lead to conditions where the company has a monopoly in a certain product or industry in the targeted market with bad implications for social welfare.\n\n\n25.2.4 The government revenue argument\nGovernment can finance their budget by raising tariffs.\n\n\n25.2.5 The national defense argument\nNational defense is an obviously legitimate goal for any sovereign government and hence, domestic industries that supply goods and services that are important for a potential military emergency should have a special protection.\n\n\n25.2.6 The wish to decrease the national balance of payments deficit\nCountries that have a large trade deficit wish – for whatever reason (see Chapter 19}) – to increase import restrictions in order to decrease the export deficit.\n\n\n25.2.7 The income redistribution argument\nAs we have learned, trade generates winners and losers and hence is a source for the distribution of wealth. Government can use this knowledge to redistribute income or decrease income inequality. However, it is almost certain that this politic is not the most efficient and best way to achieve the said goals because we have also learned that trade is beneficial for a country as a whole.\n\n\n25.2.8 The infant industry argument\n\n\n\nFigure 25.1: The infant industry argument\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic idea is that no economic activities will happen in industries in which there are no possibilities to make positive profits because competition from abroad is currently to strong. A finite protection from international competition can make firms to grow and become more productive so that they can face foreign competition after the protection is abolished. The core of the argument is that infant industries do not have economies of scale like competitors from abroad and, hence, need to be protected until they can attain similar economies of scale.\nFigure 25.1 provides a visualization that may help to understand the infant industry argument. In the left panel you see that the domestic supply curve lies above the world market price, \\(P^W\\). Thus, the domestic industry is not competitive enough to produce at costs lower than the world market price. A tariff in time \\(t\\) would protect the domestic market so that some firms start to produce and sell their goods at home. The hope of the government now is that the firms become more productive over time and in turn their supply curve shifts downwards. The downward shifted supply curve in time \\(t+1\\) is shown in the right panel. Here, the government can remove the tariff without crowding out the domestic production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 25.1 Arguments for trade restrictions (Solution 25.1)\nExplain briefly (2-3 sentences) the infant industry argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 25.1. Arguments for trade restrictions (Exercise 25.1)\nA finite protection from international competition can make firms to grow and become more productive so that they can face foreign competition after the protection is abolished. The core of the argument is that infant industries do not have economies of scale like competitors from abroad and, hence, need to be protected until they can attain similar economies of scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 25.2 Buy local be happy?\n\n\n\nFigure 25.2: Biden and “BUY AMERICAN”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many countries, including the U.S. (see Figure 25.2), people tend to believe that it is better to buy at home than abroad. A Statement of The White House on July 28, 2021 says:\n\n“The President believes that when we spend American taxpayers’ dollars, it should support American workers and businesses. In his first week in office, President Biden signed Executive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America’s Workers, launching a whole-of-government initiative to strengthen the use of federal procurement to support American manufacturing.’’\n\nThere are intuitive reasons to think that way. However, there are also some logical and persuasive arguments that confront that point of view. Please read the following quotes and discuss whether or not buying locally can be a welfare-enhancing strategy.\nThe first excerpt is entitled with 15 Reasons to Buy American Made Products and stems from www.buydirectusa.com:\n\nNext time you are in a store or shopping online look for the Made in USA label. The job you save by doing so could one day be your own!\n\nWhen you buy American products you support American workers. Existing jobs are saved and more employment opportunities are created.\nWhen you buy American Made products you support companies that are doing business in America.\nHundreds of major American corporations are continuing to ship thousands of jobs overseas. Displacing the American worker.\nSince 2000. the United States has lost an incredible 32% of its manufacturing jobs.\nTo prevent more of our manufacturing cities all over America from being transformed from thriving communities into crime infested hellholes. What happened to Flint, MI and Camden, NJ can happen in any American city when corporations decide to move production overseas.\nChina is now the number one supplier of components that are critical to the operation of US defense systems. Does this bother anyone else?\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute The economy has been unable to create jobs due to America’s massive trade deficit.\nU.S. trade policies encourage businesses to relocate production of goods to other nations without penalizing them for selling those goods back to the United States. This has resulted in millions of lost jobs for the American people.\nSince 1975, the US has imported more goods than it has exported. In 2010, the US had a deficit of $478 billion in global trade.\nOver 30 years of trade policies such as NAFTA and CAFTA have taken jobs from the American people.\nFor every $1 billion in goods imported, the economy loses 9,000 jobs.\nNo regulation or safety standards in products made overseas. Chinese-made drywall used in US homes is creating health and safety hazards.\nMoral implications of the exploitation of foreign workers and violations of child labor laws overseas.\nEnvironmental standards are minimal or non existent in how products are made overseas. This has an impact on everyone on the planet.\nChinese imports accounted for more than 60% of the recalls announced by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 2007\n\nUPDATE\n\nCOVID – Where did that get released from?\nWhen you buy products from the CCP, you are helping to fund their military which are a growing threat around the globe.\nYou don’t have to swim to get the products you need.\n\n\nThe second quote stems from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (2002, p. 16) who try to de-mystify the intuition of the buy local propagandists using a lot of data and some logical arguments of which you can read one here:\n\n“A common myth is that it’s better for Americans to spend their money at home than abroad. The best way to expose the fallacy in this argument is to take it to its logical extreme. If it’s better for me to spend my money here than abroad, then it’s even better to buy in Texas than in New York, better yet to buy in Dallas than in Houston… in my own neighborhood… within my own family… to consume only what I can produce. Alone and poor.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas. (2002). The fruits of free trade [Annual Report].",

    "text": "25.4 Trade anecdotes\n\n25.4.1 The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)\n\n\n\nFigure 25.9: The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leaders of China and another 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region (see Figure 25.9) have signed one of the biggest free trade deals in history, covering 2.2 billion people and 30% of the world’s economic output. The deal will cover nearly 28% of global trade.\nThe Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was signed over a video link on November 15th after eight years of negotiations.\nThe deal sets the terms of trade in goods and services, cross-border investment and new rules for increasingly important areas such as electronic commerce and intellectual property. The effect on the trade of finished goods between Asian nations will be particularly marked, analysts have said.\nTrade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the US and China, in which the two superpowers have imposed billions of dollars’ worth of punitive tariffs on each other’s exports.\nUnlike the CPTPP – the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership – and the EU, it does not establish unified standards on labor and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies.\nDonald Trump in 2017 pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal previously envisaged as a way of curbing China’s influence.\n\n\n25.4.2 Trade dispute between the USA and the European Union\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: Trade wars: How they work and who they impact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June 2018, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on € 6.4 billion worth of European steel and aluminum exports, followed by additional tariffs in January 2020 affecting approximately € 40 million worth of EU exports of certain steel and aluminum derivatives. The EU imposed countervailing measures on € 2.8 billion worth of U.S. exports to the EU in June 2018 (a similar EU response followed the second set of U.S. tariffs in 2020). The remaining countervailing measures, affecting up to € 3.6 billion worth of exports, were scheduled to take effect on June 1, 2021. The EU suspended these measures until December 1, 2021, to allow the parties to work together on a longer-term solution. Following today’s announcement by the U.S., these measures will not be imposed. (see European Commission, 2021)\n\nEuropean Commission. (2021). EU and US agree to start discussions on a global arrangement on sustainable steel and aluminium and suspend steel and aluminium trade disputes (Press Release IP/21/5721).\n\n\n\nFigure 25.10: Biden and von der Leyen on G20 leaders’ summit in Rome, October 31\n\n\n\nSource: REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\n\n\nIn November 2021, President Biden has signed a deal to end tariffs on steel imports from the EU, which were imposed by his predecessor Donald Trump. But the agreement does not cover exports from the UK, putting British steelmakers at a disadvantage as is discussed in an article of the BBC, see UK steel makers ‘left behind’ as US ends trade war.\n\n\n25.4.3 Boeing vs. Airbus\nBoeing has continually protested over launch aid in the form of credits to Airbus, while Airbus has argued that Boeing receives illegal subsidies through military and research contracts and tax breaks. All that yielded litigation at the WTO and a series of decisions that allowed (trade) penalties of both sides.\nFor example, on 2 October 2019, the WTO approved US tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods, and officially authorized them on 14 October, despite the European Union urging for a negotiated settlement. On 30 September 2020, however, the WTO approved the European Union’s retaliatory tariffs on $4.1 billion worth of US goods, this is in addition to the previous unimplemented sanction allowing the EU the right to impose tariffs of up to $8.2 billion on US goods and services\nThis is a trade war where nobody will probably be better of in the end. For more details on this dispute, I recommend reading the Wikipedia entry.\nOn June 15, 2021, the U.S. and the EU achieved a major breakthrough in the trade dispute between Boeing and Airbus, agreeing to end the 17-year dispute. All tariffs were suspended for five years.\n\n\n25.4.4 Trump vs. the European Union (a.k.a. Jean-Claude Juncker)\nUnder president Trump, United States imposed tariffs on goods such as cars, olives, single malt whiskey, pecorino cheese, and wine. The EU, in turn, has raised tariffs on goods such as orange juice, bourbon, peanut butter, power boats, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. This escalation was brought to a halt on July 25, 2020, Jean-Claude Junker and Donald J. Trump met at the White House to discuss the ongoing trade dispute, see Figure 25.11. They announced that the United States and the European Union would work to reduce tensions created by Trump’s confrontational trade policies in the past. Before that meeting they made their standpoints clear as paraphrased below.\n\n\n\nFigure 25.11: Juncker and Trump made a deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald J. Trump wrote via Twitter on March 3, 2018:\n\n“The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our very stupid trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!”\n\nJean-Claude Juncker said on March 2 (see euronews.com):\n\n“So now we will also impose import tariffs. This is basically a stupid process, the fact that we have to do this. But we have to do it. We will now impose tariffs on motorcycles, Harley Davidson, on blue jeans, Levis, on Bourbon. We can also do stupid. We also have to be this stupid.”\n\nDonald J. Trump wrote via Twitter on March 3, 2018:\n\n“If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.4.5 Trump and the WTO\nRead the following excerpt of an article entitled with “Trump Trade Fight Heads to Global Court as WTO Nears the Rubicon” by Bryce Baschuk at www.bloomberg.com published on 21. of November 2018:\n\nThe Geneva-based WTO has long avoided this politically fraught confrontation, which could irreparably harm the organization tasked with deciding international trade disputes. But barring any unforeseen developments, the WTO on Nov. 21 will grant requests from members including China and the European Union to determine if U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in March – and based on national security concerns – are legal.\nU.S. trade officials say that the WTO has no authority to mediate national security matters and should simply issue a decision that says the matter is outside of the WTO’s remit. WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo has gone so far as to warn countries against taking this dispute to the WTO, arguing that it instead “requires conversation at the highest political level.” The fight could end up sidelining the WTO.\n“If the WTO finds that Trump’s tariffs are permitted under the national security exception, it opens a gaping hole that would allow any other country the right to impose trade barriers on any product at any moment and for no particular reason other than protectionism” Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview.\n\n\nIn applying the tariffs, Washington relied on a rarely-used WTO national security exemption, which permits governments to take “any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.” The Trump administration has already blocked the process once, and since the rules don’t allow further preventative actions, the WTO will likely create a dispute settlement panel, which would consist of three experts. Any decision would likely be rendered in 2019 or 2020.\n\n\n\n25.4.6 Trump and his trade war with China\nDonald J. Trump said in his 2016 presidential campaign, see time.com:\n\n“We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements and cheat in every way imaginable, and our politicians did nothing about it. Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result. I have visited cities and towns across this country where one-third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years. Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export. We can’t continue to do that. This is not some natural disaster, it’s a political and politician-made disaster. Very simple. And it can be corrected and we can correct it fast when we have people with the right thinking. Right up here. […] To understand why trade reform creates jobs, and it creates a lot of them, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper. Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product. From 1947 to 2001, a span of over five decades, our inflation-adjusted Gross Domestic Product grew at a rate of 3.5 percent. However, since 2002, the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports, the GDP growth rate has been cut in half. [] A Trump administration will change our failed trade policies, and I mean quickly.”\n\nI don’t want to go into details about the trade disputes of China and USA. A concise and continually revised overview is offered by Wikipedia.\nThe following charts show the trade surplus/deficit (exports minus imports) for the USA, China, Russia, and Germany. The data were downloaded on 15th of June 2022 from tradingeconomics.com.\n\n\n\nFigure 25.12: Balance of trade of the U.S. over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.12 indicates that Trump was not successful in reducing the trade deficit. Overall, it seems to be the case that trade wars are not that easy to win as he claimed. It is rather difficult to impact the trade deficit within some years. Moreover, it is almost impossible to create more jobs that are lost and boost the economy with starting trade disputes.\nFor those who are interested: Here is a well researched article about that topic by Ryan Hass and Abraham Denmark, entitled More pain than gain: How the US-China trade war hurt America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 25.3 Balance of payments across countries\nFigure 25.13 shows the balance of trade over time for China, Russia, and Germany. Discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the balance of payments over time across the three countries.\n\n\n\nFigure 25.13: Balance of trade of China, Russia, and Germany over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina: Balance of trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia: Balance of trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGermany: Balance of trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 25.4 Trump complains about the WTO\n\nIn an bloomberg interview Donald Trump said:\n\n\n“I called NAFTA the second-worst trade deal ever made. I would say the WTO was the single worst trade deal ever made.\nAnd if they don’t shape up, I would withdraw from the WTO. We rarely won a lawsuit except for the last year. You know, in the last year, we’re starting to win a lot. You know why? Because they know if we don’t, I’m out of there. I’ll take them out.”\n\nDiscuss the legal constitution of the WTO and whether Donald Trump is right when he claims that other countries treat the United States unfair. Thereto, I recommend the article Why Trump’s wrong about WTO treating US unfairly from Kucik (2018).\n\nWTO members are not permitted to increase import tariffs without justification. An exception to this rule, however, is given when the national security of a nation is at risk. On this basis (which has been challenged within the WTO by several nations, including Canada), U.S. President Trump has issued executive orders imposing import tariffs on steel and aluminum imports for a set of different countries. Discuss whether this behavior can be considered as fair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump’s claims are difficult to assess because it is unclear what he means by fairness or how to define fairness in trade relations in general.\nWhen referencing WTO rules, U.S. policy is far from a model of fairness to others, as too many countries have sued the U.S. for its discriminatory policies. Although he is wrong in his claim that the U.S. has “rarely won a lawsuit, with the exception of last year” (the U.S. win rate is similar to the average win rate), the U.S. is the country that has sued other members more often than any other country.\nImposing and increasing tariffs based on the exception rule could irreparably damage the WTO’s authority to adjudicate trade disputes. This is because U.S. trade representatives contend that the WTO does not have the authority to mediate national security issues and should simply issue a ruling that the matter is not within the WTO’s jurisdiction. This argument puts a gun to the WTO’s head. If the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body follows this line of reasoning, any country could easily impose tariffs in the future, citing national security, without the WTO being able to judge whether or not the issue is truly one of national security. This reminds (me) of the Mexican standoff, that is, a confrontation between three or more parties in which there is no strategy that allows one party to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKucik, J. (2018).

Do you comprehend their points in light of everything you’ve learned in the course so far? If anything is unclear, please specify what you find confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s behind Trump’s trade war?\n\n\n\n\n\nDerviş & Conroy (2018):\n\n“Donald Trump’s justifications for his aggressive trade policy – that it will reduce the US current-account deficit and save vulnerable American industries – do not withstand scrutiny. At the heart of Trump’s trade war is an impulse to free American power from the supposed shackles of multilateralism.\nWAHINGTON, DC – Since World War II’s end, trade has grown 50 percent faster than global GDP, owing largely to successive rounds of liberalization under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (previously the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT). But now, U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest dose of import tariffs could push the world into a full-blown trade war, undoing much of that progress.\nProponents of free trade have always celebrated the growth of international commerce because they regard it as a sign that countries are capitalizing on their comparative advantages through specialization, which implies increased efficiency overall. By contrast, critics of free trade worry that it might lock poor countries into producing goods that offer little room for productivity growth, and point out that even if there are aggregate gains from globalization, there are also clear losers.\nIn fact, few would disagree that a static comparative advantage theory is a poor guide for development policy. A more dynamic framework is needed to determine whether trade also brings knowledge and learning to new markets. If it does, then it can be an engine of future economic growth and social progress.\nOverall, there is overwhelming evidence that trade has indeed enriched developing countries where supportive policies have been in place. Over time, developing countries have learned to complement trade policies with higher investment in infrastructure and education. But with the world trading system now under assault by the United States, the question for developing countries is how to respond.\nTo justify his tariffs, Trump points to America’s bilateral (or multilateral) trade deficits with its trading partners. But while tariffs can change the composition of trade flows, they will have little bearing on the current-account balance, which is determined by national savings and investment. If savings fall short of investment—as they do in the U.S.—the current account will necessarily be in deficit.\nTo be sure, tariffs can have an incidental effect on the current-account balance. As a tax on domestic consumers and a subsidy for certain domestic producers, tariffs reduce consumers’ disposable income and augment capital income. To the extent that more capital income is saved relative to labor income, tariffs will increase the economy’s overall savings rate. Nevertheless, this effect on the savings-investment balance is both weak and indirect.\nAt the micro level, Trump might argue that tariffs are necessary to protect particular sectors. But many of the goods imported into the U.S. actually contain intermediate inputs that were originally produced domestically (this is even more the case for China). So, to determine whether tariffs are actually protecting the value added-wages and profits in a particular U.S. sector, one must also account for the U.S. value added within imports that are now facing levies. Assuming that Trump’s advisers have explained these complications to him, one wonders what his real rationale is.\nWhile Trump’s desire to prop up politically important industries and reduce the U.S. current-account deficit has certainly played a role in his trade policy, it is clear that his main target is the WTO and the multilateralism that it represents. Trump seems to think that multilateralism dilutes American power, given that the U.S. can always use its economic and geopolitical clout to win a bilateral dispute. What he doesn’t realize is that even the world’s most powerful country still needs impartial global rules and disinterested institutions to oversee them.\nOver the past 70-odd years, the GATT/WTO system has developed into a multilateral arrangement whereby the same rules apply to all countries alike. That is not to say that bigger and richer countries lack advantages over smaller and poorer countries. Countries like the U.S. can allocate more staff and specialists to support their own producers in complicated trade negotiations, while also pursuing parallel (back-channel) diplomacy. Legally, however, the WTO is a grouping of equals. The “most favored nation” provision means that an advantage extended to one country’s producers must be extended to all.\nPerhaps most important, the WTO has a dispute-settlement mechanism (DSM) that provides for the timely resolution of disagreements between member states. Though the U.S. has won most of the cases that it has brought before the WTO’s arbitration panel, it has also lost some. With the ability to hand down binding judgments, the DSM is a unique feature of the WTO system. No other multilateral body has such a mechanism.\nThere are many ways that the multilateral system could be improved, of course. The WTO, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund should be devising new approaches to address the growing influence of Big Tech; and competition policy needs to be brought into the twenty-first century. It might also be appropriate for the WTO to adopt a form of weighted voting, similar to the procedure used by the IMF and World Bank.\nAs for the criticism that globalization produces both winners and losers, this is not an argument against trade; it is an argument for policies to compensate those who have been left behind. On that basis, those who have rightly criticized the WTO in the past should join forces with its supporters. Both sides have an interest in defending this key institution of global governance from the xenophobic unilateralism embodied by Trump’s policies.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerviş, K., & Conroy, C. (2018).

    "text": "26.2 Tariffs in small open economies\nFigure 26.3 can teach us a lot about the impact of a tariff \\(t\\) on trade and welfare. A tariff raises the domestic price of imported goods. If we assume that the imposition or change of a country’s tariff has no effect on the world price, we consider what is called a small open economy, which is so small that the country’s consumption and production decisions do not affect the world price. In other words, the country takes the world price for granted because its import demand does not change the world price.\nIn autarky, the economy represented in Figure 26.3 would consume 5 units at price \\(P^A\\), and total welfare would be represented by areas \\(a+b_2+b_1\\). Under free trade without tariffs, the country imports 8 units and consumes 9 units at the price of \\(P^W\\). The consumer surplus corresponds to areas \\(a+b_2+d_1+c+d_2\\) and the producer surplus corresponds to area \\(b_1\\). After the introduction of tariff \\(t\\), the consumer surplus is equal to area \\(a\\) and the producer surplus is equal to area \\(b_1+b_2\\). Thus, consumer surplus has decreased while producer surplus has increased. The area \\(c\\) is equal to the government’s revenue. It represents the portion of the consumer welfare loss that is transferred to the government. Overall, welfare has decreased. The welfare loss is equal to the areas of the two triangles \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\). These triangles represent what is called the deadweight loss due to the tariff.\nSpecifically, triangle \\(d_1\\) represents the reduction in imports that is replaced by domestic production, and triangle \\(d_2\\) represents the loss in consumption due to a reduction in imports and a reduction in domestic consumption.\n\n\n\nFigure 26.3: Tariff in a small open economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implications of a tariff in a small economy\n\n\n\nWhile a tariff protects domestic producers and increases their surplus, it reduces the surplus of consumers and leads to a deadweight loss of revenue. Overall, a tariff leads to a reduction in a country’s welfare.",

    "text": "26.3 Quotas in small open economies\nA trade restriction that sets a physical limit on the quantity of a good to be imported is called an import quota. It gives government officials more power and control than a tariff because they can strictly limit the quantity of goods traded and have the administrative authority to grant (or sell) import licenses to certain foreign exporters.\nFigure 26.4 shows the impact of an import quota that allows an import quantity of 4 units. In this scenario, 7 units are consumed, four of which are imported. The price at which all seven units are consumed is \\(P*\\). This is somewhat surprising because the world price \\(P^W\\) is less than \\(P^*\\). The reason is that all firms that are allowed to sell their products do so at the highest possible price, that is, \\(P^*\\). As above, the blue area is the consumer surplus and the yellow area is the producer surplus. The gray area is the loss in value due to the import rate. The rectangle \\(c\\) is only part of this loss, since we assume that the government does not sell the licenses to the best bidding exporting firm\n\n\n\nFigure 26.4: Tariff in a small open economy",

    "text": "26.4 Tariffs in large open economies\nSo far, we have assumed that the country of interest is small and takes the world market price as given. However, large countries’ demand for imported goods can have an impact on world prices. If this is the case, we can show that a tariff can actually improve a country’s welfare. Figure 26.5 illustrates the effects of a tariff on welfare, prices, and trade. In particular, we show the impact of a small tariff of 6 euros per bicycle.\n\n\n\nFigure 26.5: The effect of a tariff in a large country\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder free trade, the market for bicycle imports is cleared at a price of €300 and the country imports one million bicycles.\nNow, if a tariff of 6€ per bicycle is imposed, the tariff drives a wedge between the price foreign exporters receive and the price domestic buyers of imports pay. That is, it becomes more expensive for domestic buyers to purchase imported bicycles. This, in turn, leads to an immediate drop in domestic demand for bicycles and pushes the world market price for bicycles to €297 Given the new world market price for bicycles, the domestic price for imported bicycles is €303 (297+6).\nThe consumer surplus is now represented by the blue area and the producer surplus by the yellow area. The green area represents the tariff revenue collected by the government. The two gray triangles, in turn, show the tariff-related deadweight losses. Compared to the free trade scenario, the country gains rectangle \\(c_2\\). If the revenue in this area is greater than the deadweight loss, the country has improved its overall welfare by imposing a tariff.\nLet us calculate whether this is the case here:\n\nArea \\(c_2\\): \\[\n(1.58 \\text{ million bikes} - 0.62 \\text{ million bikes})\\cdot (\\text{€} 300-\\text{€} 297)=\\text{€} 2.88 \\text{ million}\n\\]\nDeadweight loss: \\[\\begin{align}\n  \\underbrace{\\frac{(0.62 \\text{ mio b.}-0.6 \\text{ mio b.})\\cdot (\\text{€} 303 - \\text{€} 300)}{2}}_{\\text{left triangle}} + \\\\\n  \\underbrace{\\frac{(1.6 \\text{ mio b.}-1.58 \\text{ mio b.})\\cdot (\\text{€} 303 - \\text{€} 300)}{2}}_{\\text{right triangle}}\\\\\n  =\\text{€}  0.06 \\text{ million}\n\\end{align}\\]\nIndeed, the net gain is €2.82 million. Thus, a small tariff can increase the welfare of a country.",

    "text": "26.5 Other nontariff trade barriers\nIn addition to tariffs, there are a variety of other trade barriers. These so-called non-tariff barriers (NTBs) include quotas, export subsidies, domestic production subsidies, government buy-at-home policies, and product standards. Here is a more complete list:\n\nImport quotas\nVoluntary export restraints\nAntidumping laws\nExchange-rate controls\nCountervailing duties\nGovernment subsidies\nLicensing, labeling and packaging restrictions\nQuality controls and technical standards\nDomestic-content laws\nPolitical rhetoric\nEmbargoes and sanctions\nMost/least-favored nation status\n\nFor example, product standards are much more important than you might think. For example, no car from the United States can be sold in the European Union without modifications because our safety standards are different. Another example is the CE marking (see below). Harmonization of product standards is usually an important issue in trade agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCE Marking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26.6: The CE marking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CE marking shown in Figure 26.6 is one example for a non tariff trade barrier. It is not an abbreviation for China Export, as many believe. While CE is sometimes indicated as an abbreviation of Conformite Europeenne (French for European Conformity), it is not defined as such in the relevant legislation. The mark indicates that the product may be sold freely in any part of the European Economic Area, irrespective of its country of origin. The CE marking is a declaration by the manufacturer (not by some authority!) that the product complies with EU standards for health, safety and environmental protection for products sold within the European Economic Area (EEA). Thus, it is not a quality indicator or a certification mark and may also be found on products sold outside the EEA. You may also know the _FCC Declaration of Conformity} which is used for selling certain electronic devices in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 26.1 Tariff (Solution 26.1)\nReferring to Figure 26.7, the government of a large country needs your help to decide whether the introduction of a tariff of $100 per metric ton of on steel is a good idea, or not. At the current world market price of \\(p^W=\\) 600$, the country imports 14 millions metric tons of steel. The government expects that a tariff of $100 per ton of steel would decrease the world market price of steel for $1.\n\nCalculate how much the overall welfare gain (or loss) of the country would be in case the government decides to introduce a tariff of $ 100 per ton of steel. Assume thereby that the supply curve is given by \\[\nP^s=400+\\frac{1}{2}Q^s\n\\] and the demand curve is given by \\[\nP^d=1500-\\frac{1}{2}Q^d.\n\\] These curves are also shown in the figure below.\nWhat would be the tariff so high that it makes an import of steel prohibitively expensive.\nWhat would be the world market price so low that it makes any domestic production unprofitable.\nWhat would be the world market price so high that the country exports steel.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26.7: Exercise: Tariff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution 26.1. Tariff (Exercise 26.1)\n\nBy analogy with Figure 26.5, here we should compare the two gray triangles with area \\(c_2\\).\n\nThe price per metric ton of steel from foreign suppliers will be $699 because government will charge $100 on each ton of steel which is now worth $599 on world markets. As $699 is still below the autarky price of $950, domestic suppliers will set prices to be equal to $699. Thus,\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n            699&=400+\\frac{1}{2}Q^s \\Leftrightarrow Q^s=598\\\\\n            699&=1500-\\frac{1}{2}Q^d \\Leftrightarrow Q^d=1602\\\\\n            1602-598 &=1004\n\\end{align*}\\] That means, at a price of $699 domestic supply is 598 and domestic demand is 1602 tons of steel. 1004 tons will be imported.\nTo calculate the welfare loss (the two triangles), we can calculate the left triangle only and double it (please note that this is only possible if both triangles really have the same size which is only the case if both supply and demand curves have the same slope in absolute terms!): \\[\\begin{align*}\n& \\overbrace{\\left(\\underbrace{(598-400)}_{\\text{loss in quantity}}\\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2}}_{\\text{to get the triangle}}\\cdot \\underbrace{(699-600)}_{\\text{increase in price}}\\right)}^{\\text{left triangle}}\n\\cdot \\overbrace{2}^{\\text{right triangle is of same size}}\\\\\n&=9801\\cdot 2\\\\\n&=19602\n\\end{align*}\\] The welfare gain (the new square that is due to the change in world market price, a.k.a. \\(c_2\\)) is \\[\n1004 \\text{tons} \\cdot  1\n\\left[\n\\frac{\\text{\\$}}{\\text{tons}}\n\\right] = 1004 \\text{\\$}.\n\\] Thus, overall welfare gain is \\[\n1004-19602=-18598.\n\\] That means, the welfare loss exceeds the welfare gain by $ 18598.\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n            400+\\frac{1}{2}Q&=1500-\\frac{1}{2}Q\\\\\n            \\Leftrightarrow Q&=1100\\\\\n            P^s&=400+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1100\\\\\n            P^s&=950\n\\end{align*}\\] At a price above $950, no steel would be imported. Thus, a tariff must be so high that the price of foreign steel within the country exceeds $950, that is, \\(P^W+t&gt;950\\). Assuming that the world market price would have a lower bound of $599, that is, any tariff above $100 would not decrease the world market price any further, a tariff of $351 (950-599=351) would make imported steel prohibitively expensive.\n\nBelow a price of $400 any domestic production would be unprofitable because the supply curve tells us that no domestic producer would be able to supply anything at and below the price of $400. To proof that just set \\(Q^s=0\\) in the function of the supply curve and you get \\(P^s=400\\).\nAt a world market price above $950, it would be profitable to export steel because domestic supply exceeds domestic demand and the world market price is higher than the production costs.",

    "text": "17.1 Reasons for unemployment\nRequired readings:\nD. Shapiro et al. (2022, ch. 14)\nLearning objectives:\nStudents will be able to:\nUnemployment poses a significant challenge both personally and socially, leading to the loss of income for individuals and a reduction in national production. The individual costs of unemployment are multifaceted and include the loss of earnings, increased risk of falling into poverty, and deterioration of health. Furthermore, unemployment can result in negative social behaviors, such as drug and alcohol abuse, crime, and the de-skilling of workers who become disconnected from evolving work practices and technology. Persistently high unemployment can severely undermine an individual’s future job prospects by depleting their human capital.\nFor an economy unemployment simply means that there are production factors, that is, labor, unutilized. That comes along with lower tax revenues and increased welfare payments. Additionally, unemployment contributes to a range of social costs, including deteriorating health, rising crime rates, social unrest, and political repercussions.\nIn any economy, adults fall into one of three categories: they can be employed, unemployed, or not participating in the labor force. Unemployment is usually defined as the condition of being jobless while being willing and able to work. It’s important to note that this definition can vary from country to country and among different federal statistical agencies.\nTo combat unemployment, various government programs can be implemented to help unemployed workers find new jobs more efficiently. These programs include active labor market policies often run by employment agencies such as training and educational initiatives. Other passive labor market policies such as wage subsidies, public employment schemes, and unemployment benefits can also help to improve the labor market. Each of these measures aims to reduce the duration and impact of unemployment, fostering a more robust and productive workforce.\nIn a perfect labor market, wages would adjust so that the quantity of labor supplied equals the quantity of labor demanded. At equilibrium, there is no unemployment, and wage rate adjustments ensure that all workers are fully employed. However, the reality is that labor markets do not clear instantaneously.\nJob losses within specific industries may result from technological change, which forces workers whose knowledge, skills, and experience have become redundant to seek new employment. Additionally, structural changes in the economy can affect its makeup over time. Such changes may stem from competition from abroad, technological advancements, or shifts in societal norms and trends. Consequently, workers who lose their jobs in one industry often encounter available positions that require skills they do not possess, a situation commonly referred to as occupational immobility. They may also find that potential job opportunities are located outside their immediate region, known as geographic immobility.\nFurthermore, wages may be set too high for labor demand to absorb all available labor supply. This scenario can occur due to several factors that create above-equilibrium wages, including minimum wage laws, the influence of unions, and efficiency wages.",

Firms are incentivized to bargain with insiders due to the high costs of replacing workers, known as labor turnover costs, which include severance pay, hiring expenses, and firm-specific training.

Insiders, those employed by a firm, and employers are the primary negotiators over wages. Because insiders are already employed, they possess power and are often uninterested in expanding job availability for outsiders.

This leads to a market failure, where wages are not set according to the labor market’s needs or preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.2.3 Efficiency wages\nEfficiency wages are above-equilibrium wages paid by firms with the aim of increasing worker productivity. The theory of efficiency wages posits that firms operate more efficiently if wages are set above the equilibrium level. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, recognized for his work on asymmetric information and efficiency wages, has contributed significantly to this theory (C. Shapiro & Stiglitz, 1984). A firm may prefer to offer higher than equilibrium wages for several reasons. First, higher wages can lead to improved worker health, as better-paid employees tend to maintain a healthier diet, which can enhance productivity. Second, higher wages reduce worker turnover because employees earning more are less likely to seek alternative job opportunities. Third, better pay motivates workers to exert more effort, leading to increased productivity. Lastly, higher wages attract a more qualified pool of applicants, fostering a stronger workforce.\n\nShapiro, C., & Stiglitz, J. E. (1984). Equilibrium unemployment as a worker discipline device. American Economic Review, 74(3), 433–444. http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=buh&AN=4508341&site=ehost-live\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWage increases can cut costs\n\n\n\nOn January 5, 1914, Henry Ford shocked the world by announcing that the Ford Motor Company would double its workers’ wages to five dollars a day. He later claimed this was the best cost-cutting decision he could have made. This scenario, which may initially appear paradoxical, can be explained by the role of efficiency wages in enhancing productivity and employee retention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarx and the reserve army\n\n\n\nKarl Marx shown in Figure 17.2 argued that unemployment is a necessary condition for capitalism, as it keeps wages low and intimidates workers, preventing them from revolting against the market power of industrialists. He referred to the unemployed as the reserve army of labor. This reserve army consists of various groups of people, including the long-term unemployed and those who intermittently enter and exit the labor market for different reasons. Individuals in this reserve army gain employment only when there is a significant shortage in the labor market. This group provides a readily available pool of potential workers that firms can tap into when there is a need to rapidly increase output to meet demand.\n\n\n\nFigure 17.2: Non existing Karl-Marx-University\n\n\n\nNote: The Karl Marx University of Trier has never existed. However, there have been several attempts to rename the university. So far, they have all failed. Can you imagine why?",

The difference between real GDP and potential GDP is known as the output gap.\nOkun’s Law is an empirically observed relationship between unemployment and short-run fluctuations in countries’ production. It is named after Arthur Melvin Okun (1928-1980), who first proposed the relationship in 1962. See .\nWhen people experience unemployment, they: - Cut back on their spending on luxuries. - Goods with a relatively high income elasticity of demand are likely to be affected more significantly. - These businesses may reduce orders and lay off workers. - As a result, an increase in unemployment can impact economic activity as a whole, creating further unemployment, with negative effects often varying locally. - Switch their spending to substitute goods, which may be considered inferior goods. This change might lead some firms to experience an increase in demand, such as budget supermarkets.\nThe great depression vs. COVID crisis\nJohn Maynard Keynes (1883-1946): &gt; “In the long run, we are all dead.”\nWatch: YouTube\nRead: Wikipedia\nRead: CRS Reports\nWith respect to unemployment, compare the Great Depression with the recent COVID crisis.",
