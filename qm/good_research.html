Howver, the abundance of information often leads to confusion and risks drawing the wrong conclusions. Even as a professor of data science, I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information available.</p>
<p>While researchers, businesses, and individuals use facts to gain insights that are relevant to their interests, not everyone is trained to interpret data effectively, making it difficult to turn raw data into real insights.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Many people (intentionally or unknowingly) misuse and misinterpret information and also scientific content. Many research papers exist that misapply empirical methods and therefore produce biased results or hide or disguise the potential weaknesses of the results. Numerous predatory journals are full of papers that have not undergone the rigorous peer review process typical of reputable publishers that strive to maintain qualitative standards.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I admit that it can be difficult to gain insights that really stand the test of time. Most empirically oriented scientists I know present their results with modesty, knowing well how heroic it is to claim to have “found evidence” in a social science study. Unfortunately and paradoxically, this modesty explains to some extend why some people are more fascinated by wrong but simple explanations presented by people with dishonest intentions.</p></div></div><p>In this chapter, I will continue the discussion started in <a href="doing_research.html#sec-featuresofresearch" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 1.5</span></a> on what constitutes good research. I will examine the advantages and disadvantages of anecdotal evidence <a href="#sec-anecdoteinsi" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 2.1</span></a>, discuss how to evaluate quantitative information from public sources <a href="#sec-datatoinsights" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 2.2</span></a>, assess the quality of academic publications <a href="#sec-repandtrans" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 2.4</span></a>, and identify literature of questionable quality <a href="#sec-avoidpredatory" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 2.5</span></a>.

<p>Anecdotes are great. They are true stories—often intriguing, relatable, and easy to understand. They provide vivid examples that make abstract ideas more concrete and memorable. Whether it’s a personal experience or a captivating story about a successful business leader, anecdotes resonate because they tap into our natural affinity for storytelling. Their simplicity and emotional impact can make them powerful teaching tools.</p>
<p>And importantly, anecdotes are hard to contradict. Take, for example, the argument that smoking can’t be that harmful because your 88-year-old uncle has smoked his entire life and he is still in good health. It’s a tough claim to refute, as it’s a real-life example. However, the problem lies in extrapolating a single, isolated case to draw broader conclusions, which can be misleading.</p>
<p>However, while anecdotes can be persuasive, their strength is also their weakness. They represent isolated instances, and while it’s hard to deny the truth of an individual story, the danger lies in overgeneralizing from it. Anecdotes lack the rigorous analysis and breadth of evidence necessary to draw reliable conclusions. They don’t account for the full complexity of most situations, especially in business, where decisions are influenced by many interconnected factors.</p>
<p>In business, relying too heavily on anecdotes can lead to misguided conclusions. For example, a company might base its strategy on the success story of a famous entrepreneur without considering the countless failed ventures that didn’t make the headlines. This is known as survivorship bias, where the successes are visible, but the failures are hidden.</p>
<p>The challenge, then, is to take anecdotes and go beyond them. Instead of drawing direct conclusions, use them as starting points for deeper investigation. They can provide valuable hypotheses but need to be supported by data, rigorous analysis, and an understanding of the underlying principles at play. Anecdotes can inspire curiosity and point us in interesting directions, but they should be tested against a larger body of evidence to ensure that the insights we draw are reliable and applicable in a broader context.</p>

<p>Read “How Successful Leaders Think” by Roger <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin2007How">Martin (<a href="references.html#ref-Martin2007How" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>. Here is a summary of <span class="citation" data-cites="Martin2007How">Martin (<a href="references.html#ref-Martin2007How" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> taken from the <a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/how-successful-leaders-think/R0706C">Harvard Business Review Store</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In search of lessons to apply in our own careers, we often try to emulate what effective leaders do. Roger Martin says this focus is misplaced, because moves that work in one context may make little sense in another. A more productive, though more difficult, approach is to look at how such leaders think. After extensive interviews with more than 50 of them, the author discovered that most are integrative thinkers–that is, they can hold in their heads two opposing ideas at once and then come up with a new idea that contains elements of each but is superior to both. Martin argues that this process of consideration and synthesis (rather than superior strategy or faultless execution) is the hallmark of exceptional businesses and the people who run them. To support his point, he examines how integrative thinkers approach the four stages of decision making to craft superior solutions. First, when determining which features of a problem are salient, they go beyond those that are obviously relevant. Second, they consider multidirectional and nonlinear relationships, not just linear ones. Third, they see the whole problem and how the parts fit together. Fourth, they creatively resolve the tensions between opposing ideas and generate new alternatives. According to the author, integrative thinking is an ability everyone can hone. He points to several examples of business leaders who have done so, such as Bob Young, co-founder and former CEO of Red Hat, the dominant distributor of Linux open-source software. Young recognized from the beginning that he didn’t have to choose between the two prevailing software business models. Inspired by both, he forged an innovative third way, creating a service offering for corporate customers that placed Red Hat on a path to tremendous success.</p>

<li>If teachers in business schools would have followed his ideas of integrative thinkers being more successful, almost 20 years later, this should be the dominant way to think as a business leader.

<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Limited sample size</strong>: Anecdotes are usually individual cases that do not reflect the full extent of a situation. In business, decisions often require data from large, diverse populations to ensure reliability. Relying on a single story or experience can lead to conclusions that are not universally valid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bias and subjectivity</strong>: Anecdotes are often influenced by personal perspectives, emotions or particular circumstances. Moreover, anecdotes often highlight success stories while ignoring failures. This is an example for the so-called <em>Survivorship Bias</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of context and the inability to generalize</strong>: Anecdotes often lack the broader context necessary to understand the underlying factors of a situation. Business problems tend to be complex and influenced by numerous variables such as market trends, consumer behavior and external economic conditions. Many of these variables change significantly over time. Without this context, an anecdote can oversimplify the problem and lead to incorrect decisions. Anecdotes are usually specific to a particular time, place or set of circumstances. They may not apply to different markets, industries or economic environments, which limits their usefulness for general decision-making. For example, learning only from the tremendous success of figures like Steve Jobs while ignoring the countless people who failed is like learning how to live a long life by talking to a single 90-year-old person. If that person happens to be obese and a heavy smoker, it doesn’t mean those behaviors contributed to their longevity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lack of data rigor</strong>: Anecdotes lack the rigor and precision of data-driven analysis where the empirical model that allows to identify causality and to measure the effect of causes is formally described.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, to make informed business decisions, it is critical to base insights on systematic data analysis rather than anecdotal evidence, as anecdotes are too narrow, subjective and unreliable to guide complex business strategies.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-datatoinsights"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Information and insights</h2>
<p>The information and the data you come across in private and professional contexts often comes from sources with specific interests that have reasons to manipulate your perception. These <em>manipulators</em> usually present their arguments and insights in a polemical manner and disregard counter-arguments that could weaken their position.</p>
<p>Without the ability to critically evaluate information and the insights derived from it, it’s easy to be manipulated by persuasive narratives. Manipulators work diligently to come up with convincing stories that feel intuitively right. For example, the tobacco industry has long successfully promoted the idea that smoking is healthy.</p>
<p>I see two effective strategies for recognizing manipulators, becoming a more discerning consumer of information, and improving your ability to refute fallacious arguments that yield to false insights. Firstly, identify manipulators and, secondly, be educated enough to evaluate the arguments or to consult an objective expert that can evaluate the information for you.</p>
<p>To recognize manipulative arguments, you should familiarize yourself with the tactics manipulators use. Below, I explain some methods manipulators use to create narratives that resonate emotionally while using misleading information to lead readers to desired conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional appeals</strong>: Manipulators often evoke fear or pity to trigger emotional responses that can undermine critical thinking. Such emotional appeals should raise suspicions about the intentions of the information provider because it is difficult to be objective when you are charged with emotion.</li>
<li><strong>Selective data presentation</strong>: Manipulators frequently cherry-pick statistics that support their arguments while ignoring contrary evidence, skewing the overall picture. A one-sided presentation sometimes demonstrates the author’s unwillingness to challenge their views.</li>
<li><strong>Manipulative language</strong>: This includes language designed to distort facts or exaggerate claims, creating an illusion of certainty or urgency that can easily mislead.</li>
<li><strong>Pseudo-expertise</strong>: Manipulators may present themselves as authorities or experts, despite lacking the appropriate credentials to back up their claims.</li>
<li><strong>Citing research</strong>: By referencing and citing research findings, manipulators capitalize on the fact that most people would have a hard time effectively disputing these claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognizing these tactics can create skepticism in the right place and motivate you to critically evaluate the claims that are being made.</p>
<p>To challenge manipulative arguments, you need to study the subject on your own. This often requires a solid understanding of both quantitative and qualitative research methods. I hope this course and the lecture notes can assist you in building that understanding. However, if you feel that you lack these skills, I highly recommend consulting an objective expert. The alternative is to risk becoming a potential victim of manipulation.</p>

<p>In business, politics, and personal life, individuals often need to gather information in fields outside their expertise to make informed decisions. The information encountered in these situations is frequently complex and challenging to understand. Therefore, it is essential to find a reliable source that offers valid and trustworthy insights. This can be a significant challenge. Evaluating the reputation of the organization and the author of the information is one strategy to avoid low-quality data, but even this can be difficult to ascertain in certain fields.</p>
<p>In this section, I discuss the studies by <span class="citation" data-cites="Lippert2003Relation">Lippert &amp; Sapy (<a href="references.html#ref-Lippert2003Relation" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Curtis2021Life">Curtis et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Curtis2021Life" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. The first study examines the quality of dog food and the life expectancy of dogs, while the latter focuses on human life expectancy and voting behavior, specifically the tendency to vote for Republicans. Despite lacking expertise in veterinary or political science, our background in quantitative methods and scientific analysis allows us to identify <span class="citation" data-cites="Lippert2003Relation">Lippert &amp; Sapy (<a href="references.html#ref-Lippert2003Relation" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> as a prime example of poor research design, where empirical methods are misapplied and results are misinterpreted. This study invites readers to draw misleading conclusions and misuse the findings presented. In contrast, the study by <span class="citation" data-cites="Curtis2021Life">Curtis et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Curtis2021Life" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> demonstrates a much stronger research approach.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"></div><p>If you love your dog, you naturally want him to live a long and happy life. However, uncovering the secrets to dog longevity can be challenging. Unlike humans, dogs don’t choose their food because they usually only eat what their owner feeds them. Therefore, owners have a responsibility to educate themselves on a proper diet for their dogs.</p>
<p>A quick Google search can yield a wealth of information about dog longevity. For example, here is an excerpt from <a href="https://luckydogcuisine.com/tip-of-the-week-diet-does-help-dogs-live-longer/">luckydogcuisine.com</a>, a company that provides fresh cooked food for dogs:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“<strong><em>Diet does help dogs live longer!</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Here at Lucky Dog Cuisine, we believe in feeding fresh foods to our dogs. We have been doing this for over 50 years and with good reason!</em></p>
<p><em>In a study out of Belgium, “Relation between the Domestic Dogs: Well-Being and Life Expectancy, a statistical essay”, used data gathered from more than 500 domestic dogs over a five year time frame (1998 to 2002).</em></p>
<p><em>Drs. Lippert and Sapy, the authors showed statistically that dogs fed a homemade diet, consisting of high quality foods (not fatty table scraps) versus dogs fed an industrial commercial pet food diet had a life expectancy of 32 months longer – that’s almost 3 years!</em></p>
<p><em>It is the quality of the basic ingredients and the way they are processed that makes the difference. High heat cooking, extrusion and flaking as well as chemical treatment using preservatives and additives were found to be factors in destroying ingredient integrity.</em></p>
<p><em>Our fresh foods are cooked the old fashioned way using steam and then frozen. No chemicals or preservatives ever!</em></p>
<p><em>We’re excited to be a part of helping dogs live longer and healthier lives.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading this blog post, you may feel compelled to buy high-quality food and prepare fresh meals for your dog. However, before you invest your money, you should review the information presented. After all, it comes from a company that wants to make a profit by selling fresh dog food. Therefore, you decide to do further research and read the article the blog references. As the provided link to the paper does not work, you search for the authors in literature databases such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.de/">Google Scholar</a> but without any results, likely because the paper has not been published in any journal or scholarly literature.

<p>There are several flaws and issues in this paper. Foremost, the interpretation of the presented results is false. Before going into details, let us clarify the meaning of the three numbers shown in the figure: They represent the average lifespan, in months, of dogs across three categories. Dogs fed with “products used from the owner’s meal” lived an average of about 157 months, those fed a “mix of homemade and industrial food” reached about 136 months, and dogs that consumed “retail-sold dog food” lived for about 124 months.</p>
<p>Here is an incomplete list of the weaknesses identified in the study:</p>
<p><strong>Pseude-expertise</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are several issues, such as punctuation and spacing errors, as well as the figure mixing English and French terms while employing a three-dimensional format that is difficult to read. Additionally, the inconsistent use of bold and italics can be confusing. While these issues may seem minor, they indicate a lack of attention to detail on the part of the authors and raise doubts about the professionalism of the researchers. Although these factors may not directly affect the scientific quality of the investigation, they often correlate strongly with it and are relatively easy for readers to identify.</li>
<li>The authors claim to test the differences “between the two extremes.” While it seems clear they mean the averages of homemade-fed dogs versus industrially-fed dogs, they are looking at averages, not extremes. The language used is unclear.</li>
<li>In the acknowledgments, they thank several individuals for their “priceless assistance”, “erudition in statistics”, “translation into English”, and for their willingness “to read and correct the translation”. While it is commendable that they acknowledge this help, the overall impression of the article raises doubts about their academic proficiency and independence. For example, they do not relate their contribution to the current state of research as they do not have a reference list. Moreover, the dataset, with 522 observations and a dozen variables, does not appear particularly sophisticated, and the statistical tasks do not exceed the level of a Statistics 101 course. This raises the question of why two doctors of science require assistance with statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manipulative language</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The term ‘approximately’ implies closeness; however, 36 months (three years) is actually 12.5% greater than 32 months, indicating it is not a close estimate as the authors want us to believe. A closer approximation would be two and a half years.</li>
<li>The only statistical test referenced appears to be a mean difference test. The authors misinterpret this statistical significant difference by stating that “the difference is important.” Statistical significance does neither imply importance nor causality (see <a href="identification.html#sec-causalinfer" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 3.1</span></a>).</li>
<li>Comparing the averages of two groups of dogs that are statistically different, they conclude that
<ul>
<li>“Food is consequently of great importance for the life expectancy of the dog”,</li>
<li>“home made food is a protection factor for the domestic dog”, and</li>
<li>“animals who receives varying home made food, will have the benefit of a longer life expectancy.”</li>
</ul>
The empirical results are straight forward and leave no room for doubt. This is very much in line with my definition of manipulative language, as it creates an illusion of certainty in order to exaggerate claims.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Selective data representation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The authors neither provide details on their statistical analyses nor on their data. We don’t know the sample sizes for each group, nor is the standard deviation provided for the statistics shown. The reproducibility of the paper is not given, and the transparency of their data work is low. I will discuss these issues in greater detail in <a href="#sec-repandtrans" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 2.4</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Methodological issues</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As we will learn in <a href="identification.html#sec-causalinfer" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section 3.1</span></a>, differences in the averages of the treated (homemade food) and untreated (industrial food) groups can indicate a causal effect, assuming the conditions of ignorability and unconfoundedness hold. However, the authors provide no evidence that these assumptions are satisfied. In fact, the remainder of the article presents strong arguments suggesting that these assumptions do not hold.</p></li>
<li><p>The dogs were not randomly assigned to the groups. The authors do not rule out the possibility that group assignments were based on characteristics such as weight, breed, and gender, which they also find associated with life expectancy. For example, larger dogs may be less likely to be fed homemade food due to the greater cost and effort required. The authors noted that breeds like Pyrenean Mountain and Big Danish dogs lived significantly shorter lives on average than smaller breeds like Poodles and Yorkshire. Thus, differences in size and other factors alike could be responsible for the observed group differences. The authors do not discuss the composition of the two groups and do not appear to have made efforts to ensure comparability. For example, they could have compared homemade-fed Poodles with Poodles fed industrially.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if the groups were similar, the observed averages may be influenced by confounding factors. For example, it is plausible that dogs receiving more expensive homemade food are treated differently across various aspects, including medical care-factors that may contribute to life expectancy. If this is the case, the dogs might not live longer because of the food but rather due to other factors correlated with the type of food they receive. This illustrates a classic case of bias due to omitted variables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the information provided in the study should not be used to make causality claims about the life expectancy of dogs on average. The two authors merely compared two different groups of dogs without controlling for confounding factors and without addressing potential sources of bias.</p>

However, the authors do not assert a causal relationship using sensationalist language like “voting for Republicans kills”. Instead, they critically discuss the correlations while being aware of potential sources of bias that may influence the correlation, and they do not appear to have any obvious interests in misleading the reader or over-selling their results. For example, they emphasize that the</p>

<h2 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-repandtrans"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Reproduceability and transparency</h2>
<p>While we have already addressed essential characteristics of good research such as validity and reliability <a href="doing_research.html#sec-featuresofresearch" class="quarto-xref">see&nbsp;<span>1.5</span></a>, we have not explicitly discussed how to recognize high-quality research in academic publications.</p>
<p>The quality of research depends largely on the honesty of the researcher and the transparency of the methods used. Although there is no absolute measure of honesty, certain indicators can provide some insight. For example, the reputation of the researcher, the institution with which he or she is associated and the credibility of the publisher, editor or journal can serve as helpful pointers. If a researcher is highly regarded in the academic world or in public life, he has much to lose by compromising his integrity. Unfortunately, this logical argument does not exclude the possibility that even respected individuals may occasionally engage in dishonest practices. History has shown that this can happen. Nevertheless, the more someone has to lose by being dishonest, the less likely they are to cheat, plagiarize, or falsify data and results, respectively.</p>
<p>A clear empirical methodology forms the foundations of any empirical research work. However, to ensure the wide dissemination of a study, two aspects are crucial: accessibility and dissemination. Nowadays, public accessibility of a paper is relatively easy to achieve because anyone can upload their work online to ensure its availability. Dissemination, however, is more complex. While there are various strategies to increase the popularity of a paper, the traditional and arguably most effective method is to publish the paper in a high-impact journal or a popular journal with a large readership. The successful placement of a paper in such journals is almost an art form. The paper must fulfill several criteria as well as possible: a sound methodology, a clear contribution, thematic relevance and a compelling text that appeals to the journal’s readership are just some of the key benchmarks.</p>
<p>How can you learn to publish a paper successfully? I think that it is crucial to study papers that have gained recognition and make an effort to recognize the reasons for their success. Doing so sharpens your writing skills, improves your perceptiveness as a researcher, and helps you to select important research topics and to design research projects more efficiently.</p>
<p>Prestigious journals like the American Economic Review and the Journal of Economic Literature, published by the American Economic Association (AEA), have refined and enhanced their guidelines over time. These rules are often regarded as a benchmark in academic publishing, not necessarily because they set the highest possible standards, but because they strike a balance that takes into account the practical realities faced by researchers, reviewers, and editors. Moreover, readers often prefer a swift review process, too, because they want papers that connect with current events. In that respect, it’s important to acknowledge the inherent trade-off journals must navigate: stringent standards can slow the pace of research and publication. This is particularly critical in fields like economics and business, where timely insights can significantly impact politics and society, addressing urgent needs.</p>
<p>This section looks at the AEA’s publishing standards. The path to publication with the AEA, particularly for empirical research, has changed considerably and is now governed by strict criteria. It is imperative that authors familiarize themselves with the key considerations and guidelines for submitting empirical research to an AEA journal. Although standards may vary across disciplines, the AEA’s exacting standards have influenced a wide range of social science journals. Engagement with these standards is invaluable as it provides guidance in designing and planning research that meets these rigorous requirements.</p>
<p>While each AEA journal has its specific focus and requirements, all aim for integrity, clarity, and replicability of empirical research. Authors should start by carefully reviewing the author guidelines for their targeted journal, paying close attention to any specific mandates regarding empirical work. For Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), for example, a registration is required for all applicable submissions prior to submitting, see <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/rct-registry">RCT Registry Policy</a>.</p>

<p>The AEA has placed a significant emphasis on the transparency and replicability of empirical research with the objective of ensuring that the empirical results can be fully replicated (see <a href="#fig-repgold" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.3</span></a>). But why is replicability so crucial? Well, trust is good, control is better.

<p>“Replication is the ultimate standard by which scientific claims are judged. With replication, independent investigators address a scientific hypothesis and build up evidence for or against it.

<p>Besides adhering to the guidelines summarized in <a href="#tbl-resstand" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;<span>2.1</span></a>, authors should also:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justify their choice of methodology</strong>: The paper should clearly explain why the chosen method is appropriate for the research question at hand.</li>
<li><strong>Detail the analytical process</strong>: From data collection to analysis, each step should be meticulously detailed, allowing for the study’s replication.</li>
<li><strong>Address potential limitations</strong>: No empirical study is without its limitations. Authors should openly discuss these, including any biases, measurement errors, or external factors that may impact the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>While statistical significance is a key metric for empirical analysis, the AEA also places a strong emphasis on the economic relevance and implications of the findings. Authors should not only present statistically significant results but also explain their economic significance.</p>
<p>The AEA employs a rigorous double-blind peer review process that ensures that submissions are peer-reviewed without revealing the identity of the authors or reviewers. The editor of the respective journal is responsible to manage the process which involves identifying qualified reviewers and forwarding the paper to them for evaluation. This procedure serves to ensure the integrity and impartiality of the evaluation. Authors should be prepared to receive feedback and constructive criticism, which often requires a revision of the manuscript. A willingness to engage constructively with this feedback is crucial to refining the work and improving its chances of publication. Of course, this process has its disadvantages: It is slow and imposes a significant workload on both reviewers and editors. Considering the vast number of publications each year—a number that has significantly increased over the last few decades <span class="citation" data-cites="Paldam2021Methods">(see <a href="references.html#ref-Paldam2021Methods" role="doc-biblioref">Paldam, 2021</a>)</span> and the fact that the guidelines of many journals have become stricter during the same period, it raises a question. Have researchers become miraculously more productive, or are they simply working more?</p>

<h2 data-number="2.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-avoidpredatory"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Avoid low-quality sources</h2>
<p>Writing a successful is an art without strict rules. However, you should adapt your writing to the reader’s expectations, using appropriate arguments, graphs, tables, and references. By studying credible sources, you can learn proper practices and conventions. Unfortunately, many authors rely on low-quality work, resulting in a poorly written papers. Thus, consider the quality of the resources you read and cite very carefully. Avoid predatory journals and be cautious of information from online blogs, magazines, and other media without a peer-review process. Aim to find more reliable sources from reputable institutes with a reliable peer-review process and non-profit motivations. Do not simply rely on the first Google search result or the selection provided by Google Scholar, as listing there does not guarantee reliability or quality. Don’t cite articles and books published by vanity presses. Identifying predatory journals can be challenging, but there are some clear indicators of dubious quality. Here is a checklist to help determine if a source is valid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listing in Beall’s List:</strong> Check if the journal or publisher is included in <a href="https://beallslist.net/">Beall’s List</a> or on <a href="https://www.ub.tum.de/en/predatory-journals">TUM’s website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Open-Access status:</strong> Determine if the paper or journal is open-access. If it is, consider who is financing the journal. Predatory journals often require authors to pay for publication, and their peer-review process is often questionable.</li>
<li><strong>Publisher reputation:</strong> Some large publishers serve as hubs for conferences and organizations to publish journals and articles. While a few journals from publishers like <a href="https://www.ieee.org/">IEEE</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/">ACM</a>, <a href="https://www.scirp.org/">scirp.org</a>, <a href="https://www.sciepub.com/">SciEP</a>, <a href="https://www.europe-science.com/">Science of Europe</a>, and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/">MDPI</a> are of acceptable quality due to rigorous editorial standards, most journals are of low quality or predatory. Avoid these publishers or at least approach them with caution and consult your supervisor if in doubt.</li>
<li><strong>SJR ranking:</strong> Is the journal listed in the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com">SCImago Journal Rank</a> and how is their ranking?</li>
<li><strong>Questionable impact factor lists:</strong> Is the journal listed in dubious impact factor lists? The <a href="https://sjifactor.com/">Scientific Jourrnal Impact Factor (sjifactor.com)</a>, for example, claims to determine the impact of a journal. However, the service provider remains anonymous, with no masthead, address or contact information other than an e-mail. This anonymity, which is against the law in many countries, including Europe, casts doubt on the quality and validity of the service, especially as the methodology is not transparent.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these guidelines, you can ensure that the sources you use and cite in your work are of high quality and reliability. However, note that there is no rule without an exception. For example, it can sometimes be appropriate to cite a post from an online blog. However, you should provide a clear reason for doing so. If you are uncertain, consult your supervisor.</p>

<p>Economics and business administration are a social sciences. When social scientists are trying to …</p>
<ul>
<li>…change the world, they act as <strong>policy advisors</strong>.</li>
<li>…explain the world, they are <strong>scientists</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social scientists distinguish between two types of statements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A <strong>positive</strong> statement attempts to describe the world as it is and can be tested by checking it against facts. In other words, a positive statement deals with assumptions about the state of the world and some conclusions. The validity of the statement is verifiable or testable in principle, no matter how difficult it might be.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>normative</strong> statement claims how the world should be and cannot be tested. Normative statements often contain words such as <em>have to</em>, <em>ought to</em>, <em>must</em>, <em>should</em>, or non-quantifiable adjectives like <em>important</em>, which cannot be objectively measured. Consequently, normative statements cannot be verified or falsified by scientific methods.</p></li>
</ol>

<li>Higher federal budget deficits will cause interest rates to increase.</li>
<li>Nobody should be paid less due to their gender, race, age, or religion.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The task of social science is to discover positive statements that align with our observations of the world and enable us to understand how the world operates. This task is substantial and can be broken into three steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Observation and measurement:</strong> Social scientists observe and measure economic activity, tracking data such as quantities of resources, wages and work hours, prices and quantities of goods and services produced, taxes and government spending, sales and profits, and the volume and price of traded goods.</li>
<li><strong>Model building</strong></li>
<li><strong>Testing models</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Research methodologies in social science often blend the inductive and deductive approaches. Inductive reasoning builds theories, while deductive reasoning tests existing ones. It’s a methodical interplay between creation and scrutiny in the realm of research.</p>
<p>When scientists want to act as political advisors, they are often asked to make normative statements. From an ethical point of view, however, it is difficult to make normative statements without including subjective judgments, which can make such statements unscientific. Therefore, scientists should rely on moral criteria to justify their judgments and normative statements.</p>
<p>Among these criteria, the Pareto criterion is one of the best known and most widely used. It states that only changes that benefit at least one individual without harming others can be considered improvements. This concept is often used in economics to discuss the distribution of resources, welfare economics and policy making.</p>

<p>Richard P. Feynman was an American theoretical physicist. At the age of 25, he became a group leader of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965, authored one of the most famous science books of our time (<em>Surely You’re Joking, Mr.&nbsp;Feynman!</em>) <span class="citation" data-cites="Feynman1985Surely">(<a href="references.html#ref-Feynman1985Surely" role="doc-biblioref">Feynman, 1985</a>)</span>, and remains a hero for many enthusiasts, educators, and nerds (see <a href="#fig-feynman" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.4</span></a>). In 1964, more than half a century ago, he gave a good description of scientific method which is still worth considering.</p>

<p>Here is a transcript of his lecture:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Now, I’m going to discuss how we would look for a new law. In general, we look for a new law by the following process. First, we guess it.</p>
<p>Then we—well, don’t laugh. That’s really true. Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see if this law that we guessed is right. We check what it would imply and compare those computed results to nature. Or we compare it to experiments or experiences, comparing it directly with observations to see if it works.</p>
<p>If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. And that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn’t matter how beautiful your guess is. It doesn’t matter how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is; if it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it.</p>
<p>It’s therefore not unscientific to take a guess, although many people outside of science think it is. For instance, I had a conversation about flying saucers a few years ago with laymen.</p>
<p>Because I’m a scientist, I said, ‘I don’t think there are flying saucers.’ Then my antagonist said, ‘Is it impossible that there are flying saucers? Can you prove that it’s impossible?’ I said, ‘No, I can’t prove it’s impossible. It’s just very unlikely.’</p>
<p>They replied, ‘You are very unscientific. If you can’t prove something is impossible, then how can you say it’s unlikely?’ Well, that’s how science works. It’s scientific to say what’s more likely or less likely, rather than attempting to prove every possibility and impossibility.</p>
<p>To clarify, I concluded by saying, ’From my understanding of the world around me, I believe it’s much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the result of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence rather than the unknown rational efforts of extraterrestrial intelligence. It’s just more likely, that’s all. And it’s a good guess. We always try to guess the most likely explanation, keeping in the back of our minds that if it doesn’t work, we must consider other possibilities.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Now, you see, of course, that with this method, we can disprove any specific theory. We can have a definite theory or a real guess from which we can compute consequences that could be compared to experiments, and in principle, we can discard any theory. You can always prove any definite theory wrong. Notice, however, we never prove it right.</p>
<p>Suppose you invent a good guess, calculate the consequences, and find that every consequence matches the experiments. Does that mean your theory is right? No, it simply has not been proved wrong. Because in the future, there could be a wider range of experiments, and you may compute a broader range of consequences that could reveal that your theory is actually incorrect.</p>
<p>That’s why laws, like Newton’s laws of motion for planets, have lasted for such a long time. He guessed the law of gravitation, calculated various consequences for the solar system, and it took several hundred years before the slight error in the motion of Mercury was discovered.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I must also point out that you cannot prove a vague theory wrong. If the guess you make is poorly expressed and rather vague, and if the method you use to compute the consequences is also vague—you aren’t sure. You might say, ‘I think everything is due to [INAUDIBLE], and [INAUDIBLE] does this and that,’ more or less. Thus, you can explain how this works. However, that theory is considered ‘good’ because it cannot be proved wrong.</p>
<p>If the process for computing the consequences is indefinite, then with a little skill, any experimental result can be made to fit—at least in theory. You’re probably familiar with that in other fields. For example, A hates his mother. The reason is, of course, that she didn’t show him enough love or care when he was a child. However, upon investigation, you may find that she actually loved him very much and everything was fine. Then the explanation changes to say she was overindulgent when he was [INAUDIBLE]. With a vague theory, it’s possible to arrive at either conclusion.</p>
<p>[APPLAUSE]</p>
<p>Now, wait. The cure for this is the following: it would be possible to specify ahead of time how much love is insufficient and how much constitutes overindulgence precisely, enabling a legitimate theory against which you can conduct tests. It’s often said that when this is pointed out regarding how much love is involved, you’re dealing with psychological matters, and such things can’t be defined so precisely. Yes, but then you can’t claim to know anything about it. [APPLAUSE]</p>
<p>Now, I want to concentrate for now on—because I’m a theoretical physicist and more fascinated with this end of the problem—how you make guesses. It is irrelevant where the guess originates. What matters is that it agrees with experiments and is as precise as possible.</p>
<p>But, you might say, that’s very simple. We just set up a machine—a great computing machine—with a random wheel that makes a succession of guesses. Each time it guesses hypotheses about how nature should work, it computes the consequences and compares them to a list of experimental results at the other end. In other words, guessing is a task for simpletons.</p>
<p>Actually, it’s quite the opposite, and I will try to explain why. […]</p>
