## Outline

This interactive tutorial will help you set up your computer to use R. 
It is for you if you need to:

* Install R on your computer

You can skip this tutorial if you've already done these things.

### Do you need to work through the tutorial? 

Take the quiz below to find out.

  answer("installed the RStudio IDE", message = "* Install RStudio IDE"),
  answer("installed the R packages for the lecture notes _How to Use R for Data Science_", message = "* Install Packages"),
  answer("None of the above. I've done them all.", correct = TRUE, message = "You can skip this tutorial!"),

)
```

## Install R

### How to install R

Download and install R [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/). 

-   If you are a Windows user: Click on "Download R for Windows", then click on "base", then click on the Download link.
-   If you are macOS user: Click on "Download R for (Mac) OS X", then under "Latest release:" click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of March 29, 2024 was R-4.3.3.
-   If you are a Linux user: Click on "Download R for Linux" and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.

```{r letter-a, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Quiz - R",
question("What is the price you have to pay for being able to use R?",
  answer("8 € per month"),
  answer("14 € for a licence"),
  answer("0, it is open source software", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
question("What sort of programming language is R?",
    answer("R is a functional programming language.", correct = TRUE, message = "R is a *functional programming language*. If you want R to do something, you need to use a function."),
    answer("R is not programming language."),
    answer("R is a language for communicating with aliens."),
    answer("R is a language for designing rocket engines."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
question("In R, everything that exists is considered an object. Which of the following statements are true regarding this concept?",
  answer("Variables holding data values are objects.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Functions, even the user-defined ones, are objects.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Only complex data structures like lists and data frames are objects.", correct = FALSE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
)
```


## Install RStudio

R is a functional programming language that runs computations. RStudio is an *integrated development environment (IDE)* that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. 

### How to install RStudio

Download and install RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

-   Scroll down to "Installers for Supported Platforms" near the bottom of the page.
-   Click on the download link corresponding to your computer's operating system.

    answer("An application that makes it easier to use R.", correct = TRUE, message = "RStudio organizes your workspace and makes it easier to write, use, debug, and save R code. I highly recommend it and will rely on the RStudio IDE in several tutorials."),
    answer("An application that let's you use R without writing any code", message = "And thank goodness! Code provides a reproducible record of your work, which is essential for data science."),
    answer("A spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel."),
    answer("Another name for R", message = "R and RStudio are two separate things. R is a language, like English. Think of RStudio as a program that helps you use the language, kind of like how a word processing program helps you write in English."),

  ),
  question("Is the RStudio IDE free to download and use?",
    answer("Yes!", correct = TRUE, message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features in these tutorials."),
    answer("No.", message = "Like R, RStudio is free and open-source. There do exist professional versions of RStudio with enhanced features, but we will not rely on those features in these tutorials.")

## Install Packages

Upon successfully installing R, you gain access to functions that are part of _Base R_. This includes standard packages automatically installed and loaded with each R session, such as `stats`, `utils`, and `graphics`, providing a broad spectrum of functionalities for statistical analysis and graphical capabilities. However, the syntax in _Base R_ can become complex and less intuitive for users. Consequently, many individuals, spearheaded by Hadley Wickham, the Chief Data Scientist at _Posit_ (formerly RStudio), and his team, have developed an alternative suite of packages known as the `tidyverse`. These packages share a common philosophy and syntax, emphasizing readability and ease of use. We will heavily utilize the `tidyverse` in the following sections.

### How to install R packages

To install an R package you can use the GUI of R Studio or the command line and the `install.packages("package_name")` function. In R Studio you can click on the *Packages* tab, then on the *Install* button, then you must search for a package and click *Install*.

However, I recommend to install and load packages using the `p_load()` function of the `pacman` package. It is superior because

- it only installs a package if it is has not been installed yet, 
- it loads the package, and
- does not require quotes nor the `c()`function.

Now, install frequently used packages by running the following lines of code in the Console. This takes more than 5 minutes depending on your PC and your internet connection. However, after installing all these packages you have all packages that are used in my exercises, the lecture notes [_How to Use R for Data Science_](https://hubchev.github.io/ds/), and the book [_R for Data Science (2e)_](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/):

```{r, echo=T, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
      arrow, babynames, car, curl, devtools, dplyr, duckdb, 
      expss, gapminder, ggplot2, ggrepel, ggridges, ggpubr, 
      ggstats, ggthemes, haven, HH, janitor, kableExtra, knitr, 
      Lahman, labelled, likert, magick, maps, MASS, 
      nycflights13, openxlsx, palmerpenguins, papaja, plm, 
      psych, rempsyc, repurrrsive, rstatix, skimr, sjlabelled, 
      sjmisc, sjPlot, stargazer, texreg, tidymodels, tidyr, 
      tidyverse, tinylabels, usethis, WDI, wbstats, writexl
)
```
