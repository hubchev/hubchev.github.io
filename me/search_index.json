Assessment Students complete this module with a written exam of 90 minutes. A passing grade in this module is achieved when the overall grade is greater than or equal to 4.0. Learning outcomes: After successful completion of the module, students are able to: describe how tools of standard price theory, location theory, production theory, and the theory of investment decision can be employed to formulate a decision problem, evaluate alternative courses of action and choose among alternatives, apply economic concepts and techniques in evaluating strategic business decisions taken by firms, apply the knowledge of the mechanics of supply and demand to explain the functioning of markets. How to prepare for the exam: I am convinced that reading the lecture notes, preparing for class, taking actively part in class, and trying to solve the exercises without going straight to the solutions is the best method for students to maximize leisure time and minimize the time needed to prepare for the exam, respectively, getting long-term benefits out of the course, improve grades, and have more fun during lecture hours.

Feynman’s badge photo from Los Alamos National Laboratory2 Richard P. Feynman: “I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way ­ by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!” Stephan Huber: “I agree with Feynman: The key to learning is understanding. However, I believe that there is no understanding without practice, that is, solving problems and exercises by yourself with a pencil and a blank sheet of paper without knowing the solution in advance.” Study the lecture notes, i.e., try to understand the exercises and solve them yourself. Study the exercises, i.e., try to understand the logical rules and solve the problems yourself. Test yourself with past exams that you will find on ILIAS. The structure of the exam is more or less the same every semester. If you have the opportunity to form a group of students to study and prepare for the exam, make use of it. It is great to help each other, and it is very motivating to see that everyone has problems sometimes. If you have difficulties with some exercises and the solutions shown do not solve your problem, ask a classmate or contact me. I will do my best to help.

After successful completion of the module, students are able to: Explain what managerial economics is all about. Discuss the use of managerial econmics for their private and professional lifes. Explain how managerial economics relates to other disciplines of social sciences. Well, that’s a question that can’t be answered definitively. It is whatever you would like it to be. Each instructor may find a slightly different way to define what it is. However, there are some conventions for what many people mean by it. To find out what most people mean by managerial economics, public and general sources like Wikipedia are a good source.3. More recent, many people start using ChatGPT for good reasons. Korinek (2023) discusses the use of it for academic research. Lets see what ChatGPT and Wikipedia say about managerial economics. 1.1 What is managerial economics for ChatGPT? Define managerial economics. ChatGPT: Managerial economics is the application of economic theories, concepts, and analytical tools to solve managerial problems in business organizations. It involves the study of how economic principles can be applied to make better decisions regarding the allocation of resources, production and consumption of goods and services, pricing strategies, market analysis, and other strategic issues facing firms. The main goal of managerial economics is to provide managers with a framework to analyze business problems and make informed decisions that will maximize the firm’s profits and shareholder value. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws from economics, finance, accounting, statistics, and other related fields to help managers understand the economic environment in which they operate and make effective decisions. What distinguishes managerial economics from Microeconomics and Macroeconomics? ChatGPT: Managerial economics is closely related to both microeconomics and macroeconomics, but it differs from these two branches of economics in several ways: Scope: Microeconomics focuses on the behavior of individual economic agents, such as households and firms, while macroeconomics focuses on the behavior of the economy as a whole, including variables such as aggregate output, employment, and inflation. Managerial economics, on the other hand, focuses on the decision-making behavior of individual firms, and how they interact with the market and other firms. Purpose: The purpose of microeconomics is to study the allocation of resources among different uses and the interactions of individual agents in the market, while macroeconomics is concerned with the overall performance of the economy. Managerial economics, on the other hand, is concerned with applying economic principles to solve managerial problems in business organizations, such as pricing strategies, cost analysis, and production decisions. Analysis: Microeconomics uses mathematical and graphical models to analyze the behavior of individual agents in the market, while macroeconomics uses aggregate economic data to study the overall performance of the economy. Managerial economics, however, uses both microeconomic and macroeconomic tools and techniques to analyze and solve specific managerial problems. Perspective: Microeconomics takes the perspective of an individual economic agent, while macroeconomics takes the perspective of the entire economy. Managerial economics, on the other hand, takes the perspective of the manager and the firm, and how they can use economic principles to make better decisions. In summary, while managerial economics draws from both microeconomics and macroeconomics, it focuses on the specific issues facing firms and their decision-making behavior, making it distinct from these other two branches of economics. 1.2 What is managerial economics for Wikipedia? Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managerial_economics 1.3 Simple definition of managerial economics To me managerial economics is economics for managers. That means, any sort of method, information, and knowledge from economic research that can help managers somehow in making good decisions and achieve their goals can be considered to be part of managerial economics. So, now we can discuss what economics is all about and what therein can be helpful to managers. 1.4 What is economics? All economic questions arise because we want more than we can get. Our inability to satisfy all our wants is called scarcity and because of scarcity, we must make choices that depend on the incentives we face. An incentive is a reward that encourages or a penalty that discourages an action. Economics is a social science, and as in all social sciences, many of the terms used in it are poorly defined. The following quotes can demonstrate that: John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946): “The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps it possessors to draw correct conclusions.” Keynes (1921) Alfred Marshall (1842-1924): “Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life; it examines that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of the material requisites of wellbeing.” Marshall (2009, p. 1) Gary S. Becker (1930-2014): “Economics is all about how people make choices. Sociology is about why there isn’t any choice to be made.” Becker (1960, p. 233) Colander (2006, p. 4): “Economics is the study of how human beings coordinate their wants and desires, given the decision-making mechanisms, social customs, and political realities of the society.” Parkin (2012, p. 2): “Economics is the social science that studies the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and entire societies make as they cope with scarcity and the incentives that influence and reconcile those choices.” Gwartney, Stroup, Sobel, &amp; MacPherson (2006, p. 5.): “[E]conomics is the study of human behavior, with a particular focus on human decision making.” Backhouse &amp; Medema (2009, p. 222): “[E]conomics is apparently the study of the economy, the study of the coordination process, the study of the effects of scarcity, the science of choice, and the study of human behavior.” Greenlaw &amp; Shapiro (2022, ch. 1): Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker. Backhouse &amp; Medema (2009, p. 222): “Perhaps the definition of economics is best viewed as a tool for the first day of principles classes but otherwise of little concern to practicing economists.” Jacob Viner (1892-1970): “Economics is what economists do.” Backhouse &amp; Medema (2009, p. 222) Parkin (2012, p. 2): “Microeconomics is the study of the choices that individuals and businesses make, the way these choices interact in markets, and the influence of governments. […] Macroeconomics is the study of the performance of the national economy and the global economy.” Although many textbook definitions are quite similar in many ways, the lack of agreement on a clear-cut definition of economics does not really matter and does not necessarily pose a problem as “[E]conomists are generally guided by pragmatic considerations of what works or by methodological views emanating from various sources, not by formal definitions.” Backhouse &amp; Medema (2009, p. 231) The important questions of economics: How do choices end up determining what, where, how, and for whom goods and services get produced? And: When do choices made in the pursuit of self-interest also promote the social interest? Usually, it is not a good idea to cite Wikipedia in an academic paper, because everything written down in Wikipedia has to come from some other source. So Wikipedia is usually only a secondary source. However, general definitions of an important topic are sometimes worth citing, as they can be seen as a definition that is at least accepted by a more or less large group of administrators who can make changes to Wikipedia↩︎ "],["decision-making-basics.html", "2 Decision making basics 2.1 Exercises to reflect on how we make decisions 2.2 What defines a decision? 2.3 Types of decisions 2.4 Three conditions of decision making 2.5 Decision making strategies 2.6 The rational model 2.7 Bounded rationality 2.8 Homo economicus 2.9 Decision trees 2.10 Payoff table 2.11 Review", " 2 Decision making basics After successful completion of the module, students are able to: Make decisions with a great awareness of the nature of the decision and the purpose of making a decision.

The statement of Eilon (1969) still holds true: “An examination of the literature reveals the somewhat perplexing fact that most books on management and decision theory do not contain a specific definition of what is meant by a decision. One can find detailed descriptions of decision trees, discussions of game theory and analyses of various statistical treatments of payoffs matrices under conditions of uncertainty, but the definition of the decision activity itself is often taken for granted and is associated with making a choice between alternative courses of action.” The word decision stems from the latin verb decidere which can have different meanings5 including make explicit, put an end to, bring to conclusion, settle/decide/agree (on), die, end up, fail, fall in ruin, fall/drop/hang/flow down/off/over, sink/drop, cut/notch/carve to delineate, detach, cut off/out/down, fell, flog thoroughly. Wikipedia defines decision making as follows: “In psychology, decision-making […] is regarded as the cognitive process resulting in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several alternative possibilities. Decision-making is the process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the values, preferences and beliefs of the decision-maker. Every decision-making process produces a final choice, which may or may not prompt action. […] Decision-making can be regarded as a problem-solving activity yielding a solution deemed to be optimal, or at least satisfactory. It is therefore a process which can be more or less rational or irrational…” Businessdictionary.com defines a decision as “A choice made between alternative courses of action in a situation of uncertainty.” Let’s agree on the following working definition that is symbolized in figure 2.6: A decision is the point at which a choice is made between alternative—and usually competing—options. As such, it may be seen as a stepping-off point—the moment at which a commitment is made to one course of action to the exclusion of others. (Fitzgerald, 2002, p. 8) Decision-making6 2.3 Types of decisions Decision making is a process of investing time and effort to make a decision that will lead to (good) results. In the following, we discuss some types of decisions that can help to design an appropriate decision making process. According to Fitzgerald (2002, p. 9f) decisions can be roughly divided into two generic types: routine decisions: Decisions that must be made at regular intervals. non-routine: Unique, random, non-recurring decision situations. Another common method of dividing decisions into two categories is as follows: Operative decisions: This type of decision usually involves day-to-day business operations. There is a lot of overlap with the routine category here. Examples of this type of decision include setting production levels, deciding whether to hire or deciding whether to close a particular plant. When it comes to decisions in our daily lives, an example would be where, what, when, and what we eat for lunch. Strategic decisions: This type of decision is usually about company policy and direction over a long period of time. Examples of strategic decisions include entering a new market, acquiring a competitor, or withdrawing from an industry. Renting an apartment near the university or commuting to our parents is an example of a strategic decision in our personal lives. People often distinguish between decisions at work and private decisions. Private decisions affect fewer people on average, but usually the people involved are closer to you personally. However, both types of decisions involve the same things such as people (human resources), money (budgeting), buying and selling (marketing), how we do something (operations) or how we want to do it in the future (strategy and planning). Some decisions are more important than others because the potential impact of a decision varies, i.e., the scope of a decision. For example, decisions can affect one person or millions, one pound/dollar or millions, one product/service or an entire market, one day or ten years, etc. However, it is not entirely clear how to validate the scope. It depends heavily on the perspective of the decision-maker. For a small company, for example, an investment of 10,000 euros may be a big decision, while for a multinational cooperation it is a drop in the bucket. So the scope for decisions is relative, not absolute. It depends entirely on the context in which the decision is made and on the characteristics of the person(s) making it. 2.4 Three conditions of decision making Conditions of decision making7 There are three general conditions (see 2.7) that determine the design of the optimal decision making process: certainty, risk and uncertainty. Certainty: A condition under which taking a decision involves reasonable degree of certainty about its result, what are the opportunities and what conditions accompany this decision. Risk: A condition under which taking a decision involves reasonable degree of certainty about its result, what are the opportunities and what conditions accompany this decision. Uncertainty: A condition in which decision maker does not know all the choices, as well as risks associated with each of them and possible consequences. 2.5 Decision making strategies Exercise 2.4 Different schemes of a decision making process Google for “decision making strategies” and look at the images that Google suggests you. Read Indeed Editorial Team (2023) and discuss the twelve decision making strategies. The article can be found here. Compare these strategies to the scheme shown in figure 2.8. Decision-making8 Choose a problem of your choice and try to solve the problem using the two illustrations above by making a good decision. Discuss in class whether the diagram or the strategies in Indeed Editorial Team (2023) are helpful in making a wise decision or solving a problem. Watch https://youtu.be/pPIhAm_WGbQ and answer the following questions: How is the nature of decisions discussed here? Does it contain a rational model of problem solving? Reflect on which ways to solve a problem and come to a decision, respectively, have been addressed. Exercise 2.5 The businessman and the fisherman A classic tale that exist in different version^[This one stems from thestorytellers.com. A famous version stems from Paulo Coelho^[See https://paulocoelhoblog.com and it goes like this: One day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish. About that time, a businessman came walking down the beach, trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family. “You aren’t going to catch many fish that way”, said the businessman to the fisherman. “You should be working rather than lying on the beach!” The fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, “And what will my reward be?” “Well, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!” was the businessman’s answer. “And then what will my reward be?” asked the fisherman, still smiling. The businessman replied, “You will make money and you’ll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish!” “And then what will my reward be?”” asked the fisherman again. The businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman’s questions. “You can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!” he said. “And then what will my reward be?” repeated the fisherman. The businessman was getting angry. “Don’t you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!” Once again the fisherman asked, “And then what will my reward be?” The businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, “Don’t you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won’t have a care in the world!” The fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, “And what do you think I’m doing right now?” Define the cost and benefits of both persons. Who do you think has a better life overall. Who is acting rationally here? In other words, who is maximizing utility here? The fishermen or the businessmen? Both? None? 2.6 The rational model Economists view the choices that people make as rational. A rational choice is one that compares costs and benefits and achieves the greatest benefit over cost for the person making the choice. Whatever the benefits and the costs maybe, a decision maker have to consider all and make a decision. Of course, in reality it is often difficult if not impossinle to sum up benefits and costs as the nature of both may be totally different. To get rid of these problems economists use a theoretical concept that measures both in utility. That is a general and abstract measure to model worth or value. Its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or happiness within the theory of utilitarianism. It represents the satisfaction or pleasure that people receive for consuming a bundle of goods and services, for example. According to CEOpedia (2021) rational decision making is a style of decision making based on objective data and a formal process of analysis. It excludes acting based on subjective feelings and intuitive approach. The model assumes that deducting decisions with full information and all alternatives allows for the creation of cognitive skills that allow the evaluation of all possible options and then the selection of the best one. It essentially consists of a logical sequence of steps. Here is an example taken from Fitzgerald (2002, p. 13): Clearly identify the problem. A problem can be defined as a perceived gap between the current reality and the desired reality. Generate potential solutions. For routine decisions, various alternatives can be identified relatively easily using predetermined decision rules, but non-routine decisions require a creative process to find new alternatives. Using appropriate analytical approaches, select a solution from the available alternatives, preferably the one with the largest expected value. In decision theory, this is called maximizing the expected utility of the outcomes. Implement the solution. Managers often undermine implementation by not ensuring that those responsible for implementation understand and accept what they need to do, and that they have the motivation and resources needed for successful implementation. Evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented decision While these rational models may be helpful, they can also be criticized in a number of ways. In particular, it is a belief that managers actually optimize their decision behavior based on rationality because they consciously select and implement the best alternatives. This is a misconception because any rational optimization is based on a number of dubious assumptions. For example, (Fitzgerald, 2002, p. 13): it is hardly possible to know in advance all possible alternative solutions and to know in advance the specific outcomes that will result from each of them; there is actually an optimal solution, and this solution is among the alternatives identified; it is possible to accurately and numerically weight the various alternatives, the probabilities of their outcomes, and the relative desirability of these alternatives and outcomes; the decision makers always act rationally and therefore the decision making is free of emotion, bias, and politics; and business decisions are driven entirely by the desire to maximize profits. The rational model can be considered normative because it prescribes a strict logical sequence of steps to be followed in any decision-making situation. The rational models are based on the assumption that human behavior is logical and therefore predictable under certain circumstances. This is not necessarily what actually happens in the real world. Consider, for example, the findings in the field of behavioral economics, which clearly show that homo economicus is a (useful) concept that is weak in several aspects. 2.7 Bounded rationality Herbert A. Simon9 Herbert A. Simon (1916-2001) shown in figure 2.9 received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1978 and the Turing Award10 in 1975. According to NobelPrize.org (2021), he “combined different scientific disciplines and considered new factors in economic theories. Established economic theories held that enterprises and entrepreneurs all acted in completely rational ways, with the maximization of their own profit as their only goal. In contrast, Simon held that when making choices all people deviate from the strictly rational, and described companies as adaptable systems, with physical, personal, and social components. Through these perspectives, he was able to write about decision-making processes in modern society in an entirely new way”. In particular, he proposed bounded rationality as an alternative basis for the mathematical and neoclassical economic modelling of decision-making, as used in economics, political science, and related disciplines. Bounded rationality11 Bounded rationality proposes that decision making is constrained by managers’ ability to process information, i.e., the rationally is bounded (see figure 2.10). Managers use shortcuts and rules of thumb which are based on their prior experience with similar problems and scenarios. Given the constraints of managers in their position, they do not actually optimize their choice given the available information. It is more like finding a satisfactory solution, not necessarily the best or the optimal solution. Exercise 2.6 Optimal vs. satisfactory solution Using the images 2.11 to 2.14, explain the idea of bounded rationality in the context of decision making. Picture A Picture B Picture C Picture D Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. Exercise 2.7 Are we irrational? Discuss the following statement: Since the rationality of individuals is bounded and it is obvious that individuals do not make optimal decisions, we can say that individuals act irrationally. 2.8 Homo economicus The so-called homo economicus is often modeled by the assumption of perfect rationality. Actors are assumed to always act in a way that maximizes their utility (as consumers) and profit (as producers), and to this end they are capable of arbitrarily complex reasoning. That is, it is assumed that they are always capable of thinking through all possible outcomes and choosing the course of action that leads to the best possible outcome. Of course, the assumption of homo economicus is heroic, and I doubt that any serious economist has ever assumed that this assumption can be found one-to-one in reality. However, it is an assumption that helps to make predictions and explain the behavior of people and societies to some extent. I mean, what would happen if microeconomics went to the other extreme assuming irrationally acting individuals. The result would be, more or less, that we would not be able to make predictions and the future would be a random walk. Nevertheless, economists and anyone who wants to make, apply, or think about economic theories should be aware of all the pitfalls that arise in our decision making and know that our ability to act rationally is limited. In real life, we often use heuristics to solve problems and make decisions. A heuristic is any approach to solving a problem that uses a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational. However, a heuristic should–at best–be sufficient to achieve an immediate, short-term goal or approximation. Overall, people use heuristics because they either cannot act completely rationally or want to act rationally but do not have the time it would take to compute the perfect solution. Moreover, the effort is probably not worth it or simply not possible given the time constraints under which the problem must be solved. A heuristic is a mental shortcut or rule of thumb to make decisions and solve problems quickly and efficiently. It helps individuals to arrive at a solution without extensive analysis or evaluation of all available information. Heuristics are usefull when time, resources, or information are limited. While heuristics can be helpful in many situations, they can also lead to errors and biases, particularly when they are overused or misapplied. We will discuss some of these biases in section 3.5 in greater detail. 2.9 Decision trees When we decide under certain conditions, decision trees can be a helpful tool, as explained in (Finne, 1998). If you want to know more about the use of decision trees I recommend reading Bonanno (2017, ch. 4). 2.10 Payoff table A payoff table, also known as a decision matrix, can be a helpful tool for decision making, as shown in the table below. It presents the available alternatives denoted by \\(A_i\\), along with the possible future states of nature or goals denoted by \\(N_j\\). The payoff or outcome depends on both the chosen alternative and the future state of nature that occurs. For instance, if alternative \\(A_i\\) is chosen and state of nature \\(N_j\\) occurs, the resulting payoff is \\(O_{ij}\\). Our goal is to choose the alternative \\(A_i\\) that yields the most favorable outcome \\(O_{ij}\\). Payoff matrix State of nature (N) \\(N_1\\) \\(N_2\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(N_j\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(N_n\\) Probability (p) \\(p_1\\) \\(p_2\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(p_j\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(p_n\\) Alternative (A) \\(A_1\\) \\(O_{11}\\) \\(O_{12}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(O_{1j}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(O_{1n}\\) \\(A_2\\) \\(O_{21}\\) \\(O_{22}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(O_{2j}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(O_{2n}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(A_i\\) \\(O_{i1}\\) \\(O_{i2}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(O_{ij}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(O_{in}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(A_m\\) \\(O_{m1}\\) \\(O_{m2}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(O_{mj}\\) \\(\\cdots\\) \\(O_{mn}\\) If we assume that all objectives are independent from each other and that we are certain about the state of nature, the decision is rather trivial: just go for the alternative with the best outcome for each state of nature. However, most real-world scenarios are not that simple because most states of nature are more complex and needs further to be considered. 2.11 Review Decision analysis is about using information in order to come to a decision. A structured and rational process can help improve the chances of receiving good decision outcomes. As decision problems are often (too) complex to fully capture or solve rationally. Thus, a good decision analysis should try to use the available information and the existing understanding of the problem as transparent, consistent, and logical as possible. A complex decision problem should be simplified and hence decomposed into its basic and most important components. There are hundred of different schemes or strategies how to make decisions in certain circumstances. Many heuristics exist how to think, behave, and calculate to come to a wise decision. Mostly decisions are based on subjective expectations. These expectations are difficult to validate. Articulating exact expectation and preferences is a difficult task and the information that stems from these articulation is full of biases. Decision analytic tools need to take that into consideration. Exercise 2.8 Lisa is pregnant The following question stems from a study carried out by Kahneman &amp; Tversky (1972): Lisa is thirty-three and is pregnant for the first time. She is worried about birth defects such as Down syndrome. Her doctor tells her that she need not worry too much because there is only a 1 in 1,000 chance that a woman of her age will have a baby with Down syndrome. Nevertheless, Lisa remains anxious about this possibility and decides to obtain a test, known as the Triple Screen, that can detect Down syndrome. The test is moderately accurate: When a baby has Down syndrome, the test delivers a positive result 86 percent of the time. There is, however, a small ‘false positive’ rate: 5 percent of babies produce a positive result despite not having Down syndrome. Lisa takes the Triple Screen and obtains a positive result for Down syndrome. Given this test result, what are the chances that her baby has Down syndrome? 0-20 percent chance 21-40 percent chance 41-60 percent chance 61-80 percent chance 81-100 percent chance Think about the question and put your answer here: https://pingo.coactum.de/ Code: 666528 Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix.

Calculate the optimal decision under certainty, uncertainty, and under risk. Describe and use various criteria of decision making. Simplify complex decision making situations and use formal approaches of decision making to guide the decision making behavior of managers. Avoid common mistakes when applying heuristics in decision making. Use investment calculus to make good financial decisions. Decision making under certainty means that we assume that we are certain about the future state of nature, i.e., we have complete information about the alternative actions and their consequences. Making decisions under certainty may seem like a trivial exercise. However, many problems are so complex that sophisticated mathematical techniques are sometimes needed to find the best solution. 3.1.1 Decision making with complex state of natures Suppose you have to decide between four different restaurants where you want to go out to eat (\\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), \\(a_4\\)). The restaurants have different characteristics such as the quality of the food k1, the quality of the music played \\(k_2\\), the price \\(k_3\\), the quality of the service \\(k_4\\), and the environment \\(k_5\\). The corresponding payoff table is given below. High numbers represent good quality. In other words, \\(a_i\\) refer to competing alternatives where to eat for dinner, and \\(k_i\\) are certain characteristics of the respective restaurant, and the numbers given in the table indicate the output. Weighting scheme \\(k_1\\) \\(k_2\\) \\(k_3\\) \\(k_4\\) \\(k_5\\) \\(a_1\\) 3 0 7 1 4 \\(a_2\\) 4 1 4 2 1 \\(a_3\\) 4 0 3 2 1 \\(a_4\\) 5 1 2 3 1 Domination Some alternative can be excluded because they are dominated by other alternatives. In the scheme above you can see that alternative 2 is always superior to alternative 3, i.e., alternative 3 is dominated by alternative 2. Thus, it does not make sense to think about alternative 3: Alternative 3 is dominated by alternative 2 \\(k_1\\) \\(k_2\\) \\(k_3\\) \\(k_4\\) \\(k_5\\) \\(a_1\\) 3 0 7 1 4 \\(a_2\\) 4 1 4 2 1 \\(a_3\\) 4 0 3 2 1 \\(a_4\\) 5 1 2 3 1 Weighting As the objectives \\(k_j\\) of the scheme above do not represent different states of nature but represent characteristics and its corresponding utility (whatever that number may mean in particular) of one particular characteristics if we choose a respective alternative. For example, think of that you can choose one out of four restaurants, \\(a_1,\\dots,a_4\\), in order to eat a five-course menu, \\(k_1,\\dots,k_5\\), and the outcome represents your utility of each course, \\(j\\), for each restaurant, \\(i\\). We already know from the domination principle that restaurant \\(a_3\\) is a bad choice. Suppose you have a preference for the first three courses. Specifically, suppose that your preference scheme is as follows: \\[ g_1 : g_2 : g_3 : g_4 : g_5 = 3 : 4 : 3 : 1 : 1 \\] This means, for example, that you value the second food course four times more than the last course. \\[ w_1=3/12; w_2=4/12; w_3=3/12; w_4 = w_5 =1/12. \\] In order to find a decision criteria you can calculate the aggregated expected utility as follows: \\[ \\Phi(a_i)=\\sum_{p=1}^{r}w_p\\cdot u_{ip} \\rightarrow max \\] The results are as follows: \\(k_1\\) \\(k_2\\) \\(k_3\\) \\(k_4\\) \\(k_5\\) \\(\\Phi(a_i)\\) \\(a_1\\) 3 0 7 1 4 35//12 \\(a_2\\) 4 1 4 2 1 31//12 \\(a_3\\) 4 0 3 2 1 24//12 \\(a_4\\) 5 1 2 3 1 29//12 Thus, \\(a_1\\succ a_2 \\succ a_4 \\succ a_3\\), i.e., you prefer alternative \\(a_1\\). Preferences and decision criteria Maybe not all courses play the same role for you so you can take your decision based on your preference scheme. For example, assume some courses are more important to you than others such as \\(k_1 \\succ k_3 \\succ k_2 \\succ k_4 \\succ k_5\\). Now, if you decide based on your most important course you should choose restaurant 4 because this gives you the highest utility in that dish. If you further assume that you are not that hungry and you only like to have two dishes, then you should probably better go for restaurant 1 because the aggregated utility in the two preferred courses is 10 utility units and restaurants 2, 3 and 4 can only offer 8, 7 and 7 utility units in your two preferred courses. Körth’s Maximin-Rule According to this rule, we compare alternatives by the worst possible outcome under each alternative, and we should choose the one which maximizes the utility of the worst outcome. More concrete, the procedure consists of 4 steps: Calculate the utility maximum for each column of the payoff matrix: \\[\\overline{O}j=\\max{i=1,\\dots,m}{O_{ij}}\\qquad \\forall j.\\] Calculate for each cell the relative utility, \\[\\frac{O_{ij}}{\\overline{O}_j}.\\] Calculate for each row the minimum: \\[\\Phi(a_i)=\\min_{j=1,\\dots,p}\\left(\\frac{O_{ij}}{\\overline{O}_j}\\right).\\] Set preferences by maximizing \\(\\Phi(a_i)\\). 3.1.2 Linear programming Linear Programming is a common technique for decision making under certainty. It allows to express a desired benefit (such as profit) as a mathematical function of several variables. The solution is the set of values for the independent variables (decision variables) that serves to maximize the benefit or to minimize the negative outcome under consideration of certain limits, a.k.a. constraints. The method usually follows a four step procedure: state the problem; state the decision variables; set up an objective function; clarify the constraints. Example: Consider a factory producing two products, product X and product Y. The problem is this: If you can realize $10.00 profit per unit of product X and $14.00 per unit of product Y, what is the production level of x units of product X and y units of product Y that maximizes the profit P each day? Your production, and therefore your profit, is subject to resource limitations, or constraints. Assume in this example that you employ five workers—three machinists and two assemblers—and that each works only 40 hours a week.12 Product X requires three hours of machining and one hour of assembly per unit. Product Y requires two hours of machining and two hours of assembly per unit. State the problem: How many of product X and product Y to produce to maximize profit? Decision variables: Suppose x denotes the number of product X to produce per day and y denotes number of product Y to produce per day Objective function: Maximize \\[P = 10x + 14y\\] Constraints: machine time=120h assembling time=80h hours needed for production of one good: machine time: \\(x\\rightarrow 3h\\) and \\(y \\rightarrow 2h\\) assembling time: \\(x\\rightarrow 1h\\) and \\(y \\rightarrow 2h\\) Thus, we get: \\[3x + 2y \\leq 120 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow y\\leq 60-\\frac{3}{2}x \\quad \\text{(hours of machining time)}\\] \\[x + 2y \\leq 80 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow y \\leq 40-\\frac{1}{2}x \\quad \\text{(hours of assembly time)}\\] Since there are only two products, these limitations can be shown on a two-dimensional graph (3.1). Since all relationships are linear, the solution to our problem will fall at one of the corners. Linear program example: constraints and solution To draw the isoprofit function in a plot with the good \\(y\\) on the y-axis and good \\(x\\) on the x-axis, we can re-arrange the objective function to get \\[y=\\frac{1}{14}P-\\frac{10}{14}x\\] To illustrate the function let us consider some arbitrarily chosen levels of profit in : $350 by selling 35 units of X or 25 units of Y $700 by selling 70 units of X or 50 units of Y $620 by selling 62 units of X or 44.3 units of Y. Linear program example: isoprofit lines To find the solution, begin at some feasible solution (satisfying the given constraints) such as \\((x,y) = (0,0)\\), and proceed in the direction of steepest ascent of the profit function (in this case, by increasing production of Y at $14.00 profit per unit) until some constraint is reached. Since assembly hours are limited to 80, no more than 80/2, or 40, units of Y can be made, earning \\(40 \\cdot \\$14.00\\), or $560 profit. Then proceed along the steepest allowable ascent from there (along the assembly constraint line) until another constraint (machining hours) is reached. At that point, (x,y) = (20,30) and profit P = (20 * +10.00) + (30 * +14.00), or $620. Since there is no remaining edge along which profit increases, this is the optimum solution.

I will not go into detail here, but I will show some examples of how to come to a decision when certain information is given. Before we come to the Lagrangian multplier method, let me define what (micro)economist mean when they speak of firms and consumers. A firm is a productive unit. In particular, it is an organization that produces goods and services, called the output. To do so, it uses inputs called factors of production: labor, capital, land, skills, etc. The relationship between the inputs and the output is the production function. The goal of the firm is to achieve whatever goal its owner(s) decide to achieve. Usually, it is (and in Germany, for example, it has to be the case by law) to generate profits, i.e., total revenue minus total cost for the level of production. Determining the optimal level of production for a firm is a multifaceted decision that encompasses various strategic aspects and is heavily influenced by the market situation of firms. This includes factors such as market power, demand function, production function, cost function, and revenue function. A consumer is an individual that purchases goods or services to satisfy their needs. They make decisions regarding what to buy, how much to buy in order to maximize their utility. Microeconomists study consumer behavior and factors that influence it, such as prices, income, preferences, and market conditions, to understand the choices consumers make and their impact on markets and the overall economy. For a deeper understanding of the microeconomic preliminaries related to this topic, please read section 5.1 of the appendix. Contours of the function and the constraint in red The Lagrange multiplier method, named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to constraints. The red curve in Figure 3.4 represents the constraint \\(g(x, y) = c\\), while the blue curves depict contours of \\(f(x, y)\\). The point where the red constraint tangentially intersects a blue contour represents the maximum of \\(f(x, y)\\) along the constraint, as \\(d1 &gt; d2\\). For a detailed visual explanation of the method, you can watch Dr. Trefor Bazett’s YouTube video on Lagrange Multipliers | Geometric Meaning &amp; Full Example, see figure 3.5. Lagrange Multiplier graphically explained14 The Lagrange multiplier method, named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems with constraints. It allows us to find the local maxima and minima of a function subject to certain conditions. The method involves four key steps: Step 1: Formulate the Problem Define the problem you want to solve in mathematical terms. This includes specifying the objective function to be maximized or minimized and the constraints that need to be satisfied. The problem that we want to solve can be written in the following way, \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\max _{x, y} &amp; F(x, y) \\\\ \\ text { s.t. } &amp; g(x, y)=0 \\end{array} \\] where \\(F(x, y)\\) is the function to be maximized and \\(g(x, y)=0\\) is the constraint to be respected. Notice that \\(\\max _{x, y}\\) means that we must solve (maximize) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Step 2: Construct the Lagrangian Create a new function called the Lagrangian by combining the objective function and the constraints using Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian introduces new variables, known as Lagrange multipliers, to account for the constraints. The Lagrangian, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), is a combination of the functions that explain the problem: The \\(\\lambda\\) is called the Lagrange Multiplier. \\[ \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda)=F(x, y)-\\lambda g(x, y) \\] Step 3: Determine the First-Order Conditions Differentiate the Lagrangian with respect to the variables of the problem (e.g., x and y) and the Lagrange multipliers. Set the partial derivatives equal to zero to obtain the first-order conditions. These conditions represent the necessary conditions for optimality. Differentiate \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) w.r.t. \\(x, y,\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) and equate the partial derivatives to 0: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda)}{\\partial x}=0 &amp; \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{\\partial F(x, y)}{\\partial x}-\\lambda \\frac{\\partial g(x, y)}{\\partial x}=0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda)}{\\partial y}=0 &amp; \\Leftrightarrow \\frac{\\partial F(x, y)}{\\partial y}-\\lambda \\frac{\\partial g(x, y)}{\\partial y}=0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}(x, y, \\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda}=0 &amp; \\Leftrightarrow g(x, y)=0 \\end{align*}\\] Step 4: Solve the System of Equations Solve the system of equations obtained from the first-order conditions to find the values of the variables and Lagrange multipliers that satisfy the optimality conditions. The solutions represent the optimal quantities that maximize or minimize the objective function subject to the given constraints. By following these four steps, you can effectively apply the Lagrange multiplier method to various optimization problems with constraints. It provides a systematic approach to finding the optimal solutions while incorporating the necessary trade-offs imposed by the constraints. Exercise 3.2 Burgers and drinks Suppose you are in a fast food restaurant and you want to buy burgers and some drinks. You have €12 to spend, a burger costs €3 and a drink costs €2. Assume that you want to spend all your money and that you can only buy complete units of each products. What are the possible choices of consumption? Given your utility function \\(U(x,y)=B^{0.6}D^{0.4}\\) calculate for each possible consumption point your overall utility. How will you decide? Assume that you want to spend all your money and that both products can be bought on a metric scale where one burger weights 200 grams and a drink is 200 ml. How much of both goods would you consume now? Hint: Use the Lagrangian multiplier method.15 Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. Exercise 3.3 Labor and machines Suppose you rent a factory for a month to produce as many masks as possible. After you have paid the rent, you need to decide how many machines to buy and how many workers to hire for the given month. What is the optimal amount of workers and machines to employ for the given month, if you assume the following: \\(L\\) denotes the number of workers \\(K\\) denotes the number of machines \\(Q\\) denotes the number of masks produced \\(p_L\\) denotes the price of a worker for a month \\(p_K\\) denotes the price of a machine for a month \\(B\\) denotes the money you can invest in the production of masks for the next month \\(B = 216\\) The production of masks can be explained by the following Cobb-Douglas production function: \\(Q = K^{0.4}L^{0.6}\\) \\(p_L = 2\\) \\(p_K = 8\\) Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. Exercise 3.4 Consumption choice Suppose you want to spend your complete budget of €30, \\[I=30,\\] on the consumption of two goods, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Further assume good \\(A\\) costs €6, \\[p_A=6,\\] and good \\(B\\) costs €4, \\[p_B=4\\] and that you want to maximize your utility that stems from consuming the two goods. Calculate how much of both goods to buy and consume, respectively, when your utility function is given as \\[U(A,B)=A^{0.8}B^{0.2}\\] Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. Exercise 3.5 Lagrange with n-constraints Write down the Lagrangian multiplier for the following minimization problem: Minimize \\(f(\\mathbf{x})\\) subject to: \\[\\begin{aligned} g_1(\\mathbf{x})&amp;=0 \\\\ g_2(\\mathbf{x})&amp;=0\\\\ &amp;\\vdots\\\\ g_n(\\mathbf{x})&amp;=0,\\end{aligned}\\] where \\(n\\) denotes the number of constraints. Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. 3.2 Decision making under uncertainty When it comes to decision-making under uncertainty you need to have a criterion that helps you to come to a rational decision. The choice of criteria is a matter of taste and should at best fit with overall (business) strategy. Laplace criterion In case of different possible states of nature and no information on their probability of occurrences, the Laplace criterion simply assigns equal probabilities to the possible pay offs for each action and then selecting that alternative which corresponds to the maximum expected pay off. An example is given in Finne (1998). Maximax criterion (go for cup) If you like to go for cup, i.e., like to have the best out of the best possible outcome without taking into consideration the fact that this may potentially also result in the worst possible scenario, then, you can choose the alternative that gives the maximum possible output. Minimax criterion (best of the worst) The Minimax (or maximin) criterion is a conservative criterion because it is based on making the best out of the worst possible conditions. Again, examples on how to calculate it are given in Finne (1998).. Savage Minimax criterion This criterion aims to minimize the worst-case regret to perform as closely as possible to the optimal course. Since the minimax criterion applied here is to the regret (difference or ratio of the payoffs) rather than to the payoff itself, it is not as pessimistic as the ordinary minimax approach. For more details, please read Finne (1998). Hurwicz criterion The Hurwicz criterion allows the decision maker to calculates a weighted average between the best and worst possible payoff for each decision alternative. Then, the alternative with the maximum weighted average is chosen. For each decision alternative, the weight \\(\\alpha\\) is used to compute Hurwicz the value: \\[H_i=\\alpha \\cdot \\overline{O}_i + (1-\\alpha)\\cdot \\underline{O}_i\\] where \\(\\overline{O}_i=\\max_{j=1,\\dots,p}{O_{ij}}\\qquad \\forall i\\) and \\(\\underline{O}_i=\\min_{j=1,\\dots,p}{O_{ij}}\\qquad \\forall i\\), i.e., the respective maximum and minimum Output for each alternative, \\(i\\). The example that is shown in Figure 7 of Finne (1998, p. 401) contains some errors. Here is the correct table including the Hurwicz-values (we assume a \\(\\alpha=.5\\)): \\(O_{ij}\\) \\(min(\\theta_1)\\) \\(max(\\theta_2)\\) \\(H_i\\) \\(a_1\\) 36 110 73 \\(a_2\\) 40 100 70 \\(a_3\\) 58 74 66 \\(a_4\\) 61 66 63.5 Thus, the order of preference is \\(a_4\\succ a_3 \\succ a_1 \\succ a_2\\). Exercise 3.6 Three categories Read Finne (1998) and answer the following questions: Explain the three categories of decision making. Give examples of the three categories of decision making. Explain the four criteria for decision making under uncertainty. 3.3 Decision making under risk When some information is given about the probability of occurrence of states of nature, we speak of decision-making under risk. The most straight forward technique to make a decision here is to maximize the expected outcome for each alternative given the probability of occurrence, \\(p_j\\). However, the expected utility hypothesis states that the subjective value associated with an individual’s gamble is the statistical expectation of that individual’s valuations of the outcomes of that gamble, where these valuations may differ from the Euro value of those outcomes. Thus, you should better look on the utility of a respective outcome rather than on the outcome itself because the utility and outcome do not have to be linked in a linear way. The St. Petersburg Paradox by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738 is considered the beginnings of the hypothesis. 3.3.1 St. Petersburg Paradox 3.3.1.1 Ininite St. Petersburg lotteries Suppose a casino offers a game of chance for a single player, where a fair coin is tossed at each stage. At the beginning, the player stakes $1. Every time a head appears, the stake is doubled. The game continues until the first tails appears, at which point the player receives \\(\\$ 2^{k-1}\\), where k is the number of tosses (number of heads) plus one (for the final tails). For instance, if tails appears on the first toss, the player wins $0. If tails appears on the second toss, the player wins $2. If tails appears on the third toss, the player wins $4, and so on. The extensive form is given in figure 3.6. Extensive form of the St. Petersburg paradox Given the rules of the game, what would be a fair price for the player to pay the casino in order to enter the game? To answer this question, one needs to consider the expected payout: The player has a 1/2 probability of winning $1, a 1/4 probability of winning $2, a 1/8 probability of winning $4, and so on. Thus, the overall expected value can be calculated as follows: \\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 4+ \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot 8 + \\dots \\] This can be simplified as: \\[ E = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\dots = + \\infty. \\] That means the expected win for playing this game is an infinite amount of money. Based on the expected value, a risk-neutral individual should be willing to play the game at any price if given the opportunity. The willingness to pay of most people who have given the opportunity to play the game deviates dramatically from the objectively calculable expected payout of the lottery. This describes the apparent paradox. In the context of the St. Petersburg Paradox, it becomes evident that relying solely on expected values is inadequate for certain games and for making well-informed decisions. Expected utility, on the other hand, has been the prevailing concept used to reconcile actual behavior with the notion of rationality thus far. 3.3.1.2 Finite St. Petersburg lotteries Let us assume that at the beginning, the casino and the player agrees upon how many times the coin will be tossed. So we have a finite number I of lotteries with \\(1 \\leq I \\leq \\infty\\). To calculate the expected value of the game, the probability \\(p(i)\\) of throwing any number \\(i\\) of consecutive head is crucial. This probability is given by \\[ p(i)=\\underbrace{\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\cdots \\frac{1}{2}}_{i \\text { Faktoren }}=\\frac{1}{2^{i}} \\] The payoff \\(W(I)\\) is, if head appears \\(I\\)-times in a row by \\[ W(I)=2^{I-1} \\] The expected payoff \\(E(W(I))\\) if the coin is flipped \\(I\\) times is then given by \\[ E(W(I))=\\sum_{i=1}^{I} p(i) \\cdot W(i)=\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\frac{1}{2^{i}} \\cdot 2^{i-1}=\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{I}{2} \\] Thus, the expected payoff grows proportionally with the maximum number of rolls. This is because at any point in the game, the option to keep playing has a positive value no matter how many times head has appeared before. Thus, the expected value of the game is infinitely high for an unlimited number of tosses but not so for a limited number of tosses. Even with a very limited maximum number of tosses of, for example, \\(I = 100\\), only a few players would be willing to pay $50 for participation. The relatively high probability to leave the game with no or very low winnings leads in general to a subjective rather low evaluation that is below the expected value. In the real world, we understand that money is limited and the casino offering this game also operates within a limited budget. Let’s assume, for example, that the casino’s maximum budget is $20,000,000. As a result, the game must conclude after 25 coin tosses because \\(2^{25} = 33,554,432\\) would exceed the casino’s financial capacity. Consequently, the expected value of the game in this scenario would be significantly reduced to just $12.50. Interestingly, if you were to ask people, most would still be willing to pay less than $12.50 to participate. How can we explain this? Well, it is not the expected outcome that matters but the utility that stems from the outcome. 3.3.1.3 The impact of output on utility matters Daniel Bernoulli (1700 - 1782) worked on the paradox while being a professor in St. Petersburg. His solution builds on the conceptual separation of the expected payoff and its utility. He describes the basis of the paradox as follows: ``Until now scientists have usually rested their hypothesis on the assumption that all gains must be evaluated exclusively in terms of themselves, i.e., on the basis of their intrinsic qualities, and that these gains will always produce a utility directly proportionate to the gain.’’ (Bernoulli, 1954, p. 27) The relationship between gain and utility, however, is not simply directly proportional but rather more complex. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the game based on expected utility rather than just the expected payoff. \\[ E(u(W(I)))=\\sum_{i=1}^{I} p(i) \\cdot u(W(i))=\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\frac{1}{2^{i}} \\cdot u\\left(2^{i-1}\\right) \\] Daniel Bernoulli himself proposed the following logarithmic utility function: \\[ u(W)=a \\cdot \\ln (W), \\] where \\(a\\) is a positive constant. Using this function in the expected utility, we get \\[ E(u(W(I)))=\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\frac{1}{2^{i}} \\cdot a \\cdot \\ln \\left(2^{i-1}\\right)=a \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\frac{i-1}{2^{i}} \\ln 2=a \\cdot \\ln 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\frac{i-1}{2^{i}}. \\] The infinite series, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\frac{i-1}{2^{i}}\\), converges to 1 (\\(\\lim _{I \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\frac{i-1}{2^{i}}=1\\)). Thus, given an ex ante unbounded number of throws, the expected utility of the game is given by \\[ E(u(W(\\infty)))=a \\cdot \\ln 2 . \\] In experiments in which people were offered this game, their willingness to pay was roughly between 2 and 3 Euro. Thus, the suggests logarithmic utility function seems to be a pretty realistic specification. The main reason is mathematically that the increasing expected payoff has decreasing marginal utility and hence the utility function reflects the risk aversion of many people. Exercise 3.7 Rationality and risk There are 90 balls in an box. It is known that 30 of them are red, the remaining 60 are blue or green. An individual can choose between the following lotteries: Payoff probability Lottery 1 100 Euro if a red ball is drawn 0 Euro else \\(p=\\frac{1}{3}\\) Lottery 2 100 Euro if a blue ball is drawn 0 Euro else \\(0 \\leq p \\leq \\frac{2}{3}\\) In a second variant it has the choice between the following lotteries: Payoff probability Lottery 3 100 Euro if a red or green ball is drawn or 0 Euro else \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\leq p \\leq 1\\) Lottery 4 100 Euro if a blue or green ball is drawn or 0 Euro else \\(p=\\frac{2}{3}\\) Which of the lotteries does the individual choose on the basis of expected values (risk neutral)? Which of the lotteries does the individual choose on the basis of expected utility if the utility of a payoff of \\(x\\) is given by \\(u(x) = x^2\\)? Empirical studies, e.g. , show, however, that most individuals will usually choose lotteries 1 and 4. will. Discuss: Is this consistent with rational behavior? 3.4 Decision making with conditional probabilities (Bayes’ theorem) After successful completion of the module, students are able to: Understand and use the terminology of probability.

Intersection: \\(A \\cap B\\) Union: \\(A \\cup B\\) Relative complement: \\(\\neg A \\cup B\\) School Stuff The next chapter will deal with stochastics. In Germany, stochastics is taught in the Gymnasium. If you are not from Germany, it was probably also part of your school experience. When I moved to Cologne in 2020, I found the following page shown in figure 3.10 that I had received from my high school math teacher. It was September 1993 and I was a desperate fifth grader in my fourth week. Perhaps you’d like to share your experiences with stochastics? Relative complement: \\(\\neg A \\cup B\\) 3.4.1 Terminology: \\(P(A)\\), \\(P(A|B)\\), \\(\\Omega\\), \\(\\cap\\), \\(\\neg\\), … 3.4.1.1 Sample space A result of an experiment is called an outcome. An experiment is a planned operation carried out under controlled conditions. Flipping a fair coin twice is an example of an experiment. The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. The Greek letter \\(\\Omega\\) is often used to denote the sample space. For example, if you flip a fair coin, \\(\\Omega = \\{H, T\\}\\) where the outcomes heads and tails are denoted with \\(H\\) and \\(T\\), respectively. Example: Sample space Find the sample space for the following experiments: One coin is tossed. Two coins are tossed once. Two dices are tossed once. Picking two marbles, one at a time, from a bag that contains many blue, \\(B\\), and red marbles, \\(R\\). Solutions: \\(\\Omega = \\{head, tail\\}\\) \\(\\Omega = \\{(head, head), (tail, tail),(head, tail),(tail, head)\\}\\) Overall, 36 different outcomes: \\(\\{ (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,1),(2,2),\\dots,(6,6) \\}\\) \\(\\Omega = \\{(B,B), (B,R), (R,B), (R,R)\\}\\). Overall, there are three ways to represent a sample space: to list the possible outcomes (see example above), to create a tree diagram (see 3.11), or to create a Venn diagram (see 3.12). Tree diagramm Venn diagramm 3.4.1.2 Probability Probability is a measure that is associated with how certain we are of outcomes of a particular experiment or activity. The probability of an event \\(A\\), written \\(P(A)\\), is defined as \\[ P(A)=\\frac{\\ text{Number of outcomes favorable to the occurrence of } A}{\\text{Total number of equally likely outcomes}}=\\frac{n(A)}{n(\\Omega)} \\] For example, A dice has 6 sides with 6 different numbers on it. In particular, the set of elements of a dice is \\(M=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). Thus, the probability to receive a 6 is 1/6 because we look for one wanted outcome in six possible outcomes. Example: Probability When a fair dice is thrown, what is the probability of getting the number 5, a number that is a multiple of 3, a number that is greater than 6, a positive number that is less than 7. Solutions: A fair dice is an unbiased dice where each of the six numbers is equally likely to turn up. The sample space is \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). Let A be the event of getting the number 5, \\(A=\\{5\\}\\). Then, \\(P(A)=\\frac{1}{6}\\). Let \\(B\\) be the event of getting a multiple of 3, \\(B=\\{3, 6\\}\\). Then, \\(P(B)=\\frac{1}{3}\\). Let \\(C\\) be the event of getting a number greater than 6, \\(C=7,8,\\dots\\). Then, \\(P(C)=0\\) as there is no number greater than 6 in the sample space \\(\\Omega=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). A probability of 0 means the event will never occur. Let D be the event of getting a number less than 7, \\(D=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\). Then, \\(P=1\\) as the event will always occur. 3.4.1.3 The complement of an event (\\(\\neg-Event\\)) The complement of event \\(A\\) is denoted with a \\(\\neg A\\) or sometimes with a superscript `c’ like \\(A^c\\). It consists of all outcomes that are not in \\(A\\). Thus, it should be clear that \\(P(A) + P(\\neg A) =! 1\\). For example, let the sample space be \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) and let \\(A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\). Then, \\(\\neg A = \\{5, 6\\}\\); \\(P(A) = \\frac{4}{6}\\); \\(P(\\neg A) = \\frac{2}{6}\\); and \\(P(A) + P(\\neg A) = \\frac{4}{6}+\\frac{2}{6} = 1\\). 3.4.1.4 Independent events (AND-events) Two events are independent when the outcome of the first event does not influence the outcome of the second event. For example, if you throw a dice and a coin, the number on the dice does not affect whether the result you get on the coin. More formally, two events are independent if the following are true: \\[\\begin{align*} P(A|B) &amp;= P(A)\\\\ P(B|A) &amp;= P(B)\\\\ P(A \\cap B) &amp;= P(A)P(B) \\end{align*}\\] To calculate the probability of two independent events (\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)) happen, the probability of the first event, \\(P(X)\\), has to be multiplied with the probability of the second event, \\(P(Y)\\): \\[ P(X \\text{ and } Y)=P(X \\cap Y)=P(X)\\cdot P(Y),\\] where \\(\\cap\\) stands for `and’. For example, let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\) and \\(\\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}\\), respectively. Then \\(A \\cap B = \\{4, 5\\}\\). Example: Three dices Suppose you have three dice. Calculate the probability of getting three 4$.} Solutions: The probability of getting a \\(4\\) on one dice is 1/6. The probability of getting three \\(4\\) is: \\[ P(4 \\cap 4 \\cap 4) = \\frac{1}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{6}\\cdot \\frac{1}{6}= \\frac{1}{216} \\] 3.4.1.5 Dependent events (\\(|\\)-Events) Events are dependent when one event affects the outcome of the other. If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are dependent events then the probability of both occurring is the product of the probability of \\(A\\) and the probability of \\(A\\) after \\(B\\) has occurred: \\[\\begin{align*} P(A \\cap B)&amp;=P(A)\\cdot P(B|A),\\\\ \\Leftrightarrow P(B|A)&amp;=\\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}\\cdot \\end{align*}\\] where $|A$' stands forafter A has occurred’, or `given A has occurred’. In other words, \\(P(B|A)\\) is the probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\). This equation is also known as the Multiplication Rule. The conditional probability of A given B is written \\(P(A|B)\\). \\(P(A|B)\\) is the probability that event A will occur given that the event B has already occurred. A conditional reduces the sample space. We calculate the probability of A from the reduced sample space B. The formula to calculate \\(P(A|B)\\) is \\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P\\left(A\\cap B\\right)}{P\\left(B\\right)}\\] where \\(P(B)\\) is greater than zero. This formula is also known as Bayes’ Theorem, which is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities, states that \\[ P(A)P(B|A)=P(B)P(A|B) \\] This is true since \\(P(A \\cap B)=P(B \\cap A)\\) and due to the fact that \\(P(A\\cap B)=P(B\\mid A)P(A)\\), we can write Bayes’ Theorem as \\[P(A\\mid B)={\\frac {P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}}.\\] The box below summarizes the important facts w.r.t. Bayes’ Theorem. For example, suppose we toss a fair, six-sided die. The sample space \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). Let \\(A\\) be face is 2 or 3 and let \\(B\\) be face is even (2, 4, 6). To calculate \\(P(A|B)\\), we count the number of outcomes 2 or 3 in the sample space \\(B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}\\). Then we divide that by the number of outcomes \\(B\\) (rather than \\(\\Omega\\)). We get the same result by using the formula. Remember that \\(\\Omega\\) has six outcomes. \\[P(A\\mid B)=\\frac{P(B\\cap A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\text{number of outcomes that are 2 or 3 and even}}{6}}{\\frac{\\text{number of outcomes that are even}}{6}}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{6}}{\\frac{3}{6}}=\\frac{1}{3} \\] 3.4.2 Bayes’ Theorem The theorem states that \\[P(A\\mid B)={\\frac {P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}} \\] if \\(P(B)\\neq 0\\) and \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are events. It simply uses the following logical facts: \\[P(B\\cap A)=P(A\\cap B),\\] \\[P(A\\mid B)=\\frac {P(A\\cap B)}{P(B)}, \\text{ and}\\] \\[P(B\\mid A)=\\frac {P(A\\cap B)}{P(A)},\\] or, to put it in one line: \\[ P(A\\cap B)= P(B\\cap A)=P(A\\mid B)P(B)=P(B\\mid A)P(A). \\] Sometimes, it is helpful to re-write the Theorem as follows: \\[P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|\\neg B)P(\\neg B), \\text{ and}\\] \\[P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\\neg A)P(\\neg A),\\] Example: Purse A purse contains four € 5 bills, five € 10 bills and three € 20 bills. Two bills are selected randomly without the first selection being replaced. Find the probability that two € 5 bills are selected. Solutions: There are four € 5 bills. There are a total of twelve bills. The probability to select at first a € 5 bill then is \\(P(\\text{€} 5) = \\frac{4}{12}\\). As the the result of the first draw affects the probability of the second draw, we have to consider that there are only three € 5 bills left and there are a total of eleven bills left. Thus, \\[ P(\\text{€} 5 | \\text{€} 5)=\\frac{3}{11} \\] and \\[ P(\\text{€} 5 \\cap \\text{€} 5) = P(\\text{€} 5) \\cdot P(\\text{€}) 5 | \\text{€} 5) = \\frac{4}{12} \\cdot \\frac{3}{11}=\\frac{1}{11}. \\] The probability of drawing a € 5 bill and then another € 5 bill is \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\).

Behavioral economics, pioneered by Amos Tversky (1937-1996) and 2002 Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahnemann (*1934), has identified several biases that explain why and when people fail to act perfectly rationally. In the following sections, we will explore some of the most prominent biases that arise from humans relying on heuristics in decision-making. Specifically, we will describe biases result from the use of availability, representative, and confirmation heuristics and can lead to flawed decision-making and negative outcomes for individuals and organizations. By recognizing and accounting for these biases, we can make better decisions. 3.5.1 Availability heuristic The availability heuristic refers to our tendency to make judgments or decisions based on information that is easily retrievable from memory. For example, if someone hears a lot of news about a particular stock or investment, they may be more likely to invest in it, even if there are other better investment options available. This bias can also lead individuals to overestimate the frequency of certain events, such as the likelihood of a market crash, based on recent media coverage. 3.5.2 Representative heuristic The representative heuristic refers to our tendency to make judgments based on how similar something is to a stereotype or preconceived notion. For example, an investor might assume that a company with a flashy website and marketing materials is more successful than a company with a more low-key image, even if the latter is actually more profitable. This bias can also lead to assumptions about the performance of certain investment strategies based on their resemblance to other successful strategies. 3.5.3 Confirmation heuristic The confirmation heuristic refers to our tendency to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. For example, an investor who strongly believes in the potential of a particular investment might only read news and analysis that supports their belief and ignore any information that suggests otherwise. This can lead to a failure to consider potential risks and downsides of an investment. Exercise 3.11 Twelve cognitive biases In the textbook of Bazerman &amp; Moore (2017) twelve cognitive biases that are described. Read chapter 2 of the book and summarize the twelve biases in a sentence. Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. 3.6 Decision making and money 3.6.1 Financial literacy You are financially literate if you understand and manage personal finances effectively. It involves having a basic understanding of financial concepts, such as budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt. Financial literacy also includes knowledge of financial products and services, such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and insurance. Being financially literate means having the skills and knowledge to make informed financial decisions, and being able to assess risks and opportunities when it comes to managing money. It is an important life skill that can help individuals achieve their financial goals, build wealth, and avoid financial pitfalls. Being better-educated was always associated with having more financial knowledge (Figure 1) across the countries we examined,3 yet we also found that education is not enough. That is, even well-educated people are not necessarily savvy about money. Unfortunately, financial illiteracy is widespread. While being better-educated is associated with making better financial decisions on average, “even well-educated people are not necessarily savvy about money” (Mitchell &amp; Lusardi, 2015, p. 3). There are various attempts to assess the levels of financial literacy. See https://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-education/measuringfinancialliteracy.htm for example. Exercise 3.12 S&amp;P Global FinLit Survey One example of a comprehend way to measure financial literacy stems from the Standard &amp; Poor`s Ratings Services Global Financial Literacy Survey (see Klapper &amp; Lusardi, 2020). They ask the following multiple-choice questions: Suppose you have some money. Is it safer to put your money into one business or investment, or to put your money into multiple businesses or investments? One business or investment Multiple businesses or investments Don`t know Refused to answer Suppose over the next 10 years the prices of the things you buy double. If your income also doubles, will you be able to buy less than you can buy today, the same as you can buy today, or more than you can buy today? Less The same More Don`t know Refused to answer Suppose you need to borrow $100. Which is the lower amount to pay back: $105 or $100 plus 3%? $105 $100 plus 3% Don`t know Refused to answer Suppose you put money in the bank for 2 years and the bank agrees to add 15% per year to your account. Will the bank add more money to your account the second year than it did the first year, or will it add the same amount of money both years? More The same Don`t know Refused to answer Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the bank adds 10% per year to the account. How much money would you have in the account after 5 years if you did not remove any money from the account? More than $150 Exactly $150 Less than $150 Don`t know Refused to answer These questions cover four fields of financial literacy, i.e., risk diversification, inflation and purchasing power, numeracy (simple calculations related to interest rates), and compound interest (interest payments increase exponentially over time). Knowledge in these concepts is important to make good financial decisions and to manage risk. Try to answer these quesions and compare your performance with the results shown in Klapper &amp; Lusardi (2020). Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. Exercise 3.13 The big three questions Referring to Mitchell &amp; Lusardi (2015), only 21.7% of individuals in Germany with a lower secondary education and 72% of those with tertiary education can correctly answer all three of the following questions. Try it yourself! Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow? More than $102 Exactly $102 Less than $102 Do not know Refuse to answer Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, how much would you be able to buy with the money in this account? More than today Exactly the same Less than today Do not know Refuse to answer Please tell me whether this statement is true or false: “Buying a single company’s stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.” True False Do not know Refuse to answer These three questions are designed to measure Lusardi &amp; Mitchell (2014) reports that in many countries the financial illiteracy is considerably high as the following table shows: Financial literacy around the World % all correct % none correct Germany 57 10 Netherlands 46 11 United States 35 10 Italy 28 20 Sweden 27 11 Japan 27 17 New Zealand 27 4 Russia 3 28 Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. 3.6.2 Common investment mistakes Investing can be a daunting task, but avoiding some common investment mistakes can help set you on the right path to financial success.

Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. 3.6.3 Simple financial mathematics I discuss financial mathematics in the following chapter just briefly. If you want to gather a deeper understanding, I recommend the open textbook of Dahlquist et al. (2022) or the respective chapters of Wilkinson (2022). 3.6.3.1 Simple Interest Suppose \\(r\\) denotes annual interest rates, \\(P\\) denotes the initial deposit which earns the interest, \\(A\\) denotes the capital or the amount due which is th compound amount. Thus, the relationship of these for a single year is \\[ A=P+Pr=P(1+r) \\] and for many years, \\(t\\), it is \\[ A=P(1+rt) \\] which is the simple interest formula. It gives the amount due when the annual interests does not become part of the deposit \\(P\\). But if the annual interest, \\(P(1+r)\\), is added to \\(P\\), we need a formula that takes this into account, and for two periods this is \\[ A=P\\cdot [(1+r)\\cdot(1+r)]=P(1+r)^2 \\] and for t periods \\[ A=P(1+r)^t \\] 3.6.3.2 Compound interest Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on principal plus interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, or adding it to the loaned capital rather than paying it out, or requiring payment from borrower, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest. \\[ A=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt} \\] Example Suppose a principal amount of $1,500 is deposited in a bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded quarterly. Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with \\(P = 1500\\), \\(r = 0.043\\) (4.3%), \\(n = 4\\), and \\(t = 6\\): \\[ A=1500\\times\\left(1+\\frac{0.043}{4}\\right)^{4\\times 6}\\approx 1938.84 \\] So the amount \\(A\\) after 6 years is approximately $1,938.84. Subtracting the original principal from this amount gives the amount of interest received: \\(1938.84-1500=438.84\\) 3.6.3.3 Continuously compounded interest As \\(n\\), the number of compounding periods per year, increases without limit, the case is known as continuous compounding, in which case the effective annual rate approaches an upper limit of \\(e^r- 1\\), where \\(e\\) is a mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm. Continuous compounding can be thought of as making the compounding period infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the limit as \\(n\\) goes to infinity. The amount after \\(t\\) periods of continuous compounding can be expressed in terms of the initial amount \\(P\\) as \\[ A=Pe^{rt} \\] 3.6.3.4 Present value The present is the value of an expected income stream determined as of the date of valuation. The present value is usually less than the future value because money has interest-earning potential, a characteristic referred to as the time value of money, except during times of zero- or negative interest rates, when the present value will be equal or more than the future value. Time value can be described with the simplified phrase, ``A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow’‘. Here, ’worth more’ means that its value is greater than tomorrow. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because the dollar can be invested and earn a day’s worth of interest, making the total accumulate to a value more than a dollar by tomorrow. \\[ P=Ae^{-rt} \\] 3.6.4 Net present value and internal rate of return When making decisions about financial products such as investments or loans, it is important to consider their long-term impact on your finances. Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are two key indicators that can help guide decision making and determine whether a financial product is a good investment. Net Present Value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of all cash inflows and the present value of all cash outflows over a given time period. The formula to calculate NPV is: \\[ NPV = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n} - C_0 \\] where \\(C_n\\) denotes net cash inflow during the period \\(n\\), \\(r\\) the discount rate, or the cost of capital, \\(n\\) the number of periods, and \\(C_0\\) the initial investment. In other words, NPV helps determine the current value of future cash flows, adjusted for the time value of money. A positive NPV indicates that an investment is expected to generate a return greater than the cost of capital, while a negative NPV suggests that the investment is likely to result in a loss. Internal Rate of Return (IRR), on the other hand, is the discount rate that makes the NPV of all cash inflows equal to the NPV of all cash outflows. The formula to calculate IRR is: \\[ 0 = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\frac{C_n}{(1+IRR)^n} \\] where \\(C_n\\) denotes the net cash inflow during the period \\(n\\), \\(IRR\\) the internal rate of return, \\(n\\) the number of periods, and \\(C_0\\) the initial investment. IRR can be thought of as the rate of return an investment generates over time, taking into account the time value of money. When comparing different investment opportunities, a higher IRR generally indicates a more profitable investment. Both NPV and IRR are important tools to help individuals make informed decisions about financial products. By comparing the NPV and IRR of different investment options, individuals can determine which investments are likely to generate the greatest returns over time, and which products may not be worth the initial investment. It is worth noting that while NPV and IRR are useful indicators for decision making, they are not the only factors to consider. Individuals should also consider other important factors such as risk, liquidity, and diversification when evaluating different financial products. By taking a holistic approach and considering all relevant factors, individuals can make informed decisions that are best suited to their financial goals and circumstances. Exercise 3.15 Investment case You deposit 1,000 euros today into a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5% for 2 years.

Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. 3.6.5 A note on growth rates and the logarithm Most data are recorded for discrete periods of time (e.g., quarters, years). Consequently, it is often useful to model economic dynamics in discrete periods of time. A good linear approximation to a growth rate from time \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=1\\) in \\(x\\) is \\(\\ln x_0 - \\ln x_1\\): \\[ \\frac{x_1 - x_0}{x_0} \\approx \\ln x_1 - \\ln x_0 \\] Let us prove that with some numbers of per capita real GDP for the US and Japan in 1950 and 1989: What are the annual average growth rates over this period for the US and Japan? Here is one way to answer this question: \\[ Y_{1989} = (1 + g)^{39} \\cdot Y_{1950} \\] Consequently, \\(g\\) can be calculated as: \\[ (1 + g) = \\left(\\frac{Y_{1989}}{Y_{1950}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{39}} \\] Yielding \\(g = 0.0195\\) for the US and \\(g = 0.0597\\) for Japan. The US grew at an average growth rate of about 2% annually over the period, while Japan grew at about 6% annually. The following method gives a close approximation to the answer above and will be useful in other contexts. A useful approximation is that for any small number \\(x\\): \\(\\ln (1 + x) \\approx x\\) Now, we can take the natural log of both sides of: \\[ \\frac{Y_{1989}}{Y_{1950}} = (1 + g)^{39} \\] to get: \\[ \\ln (Y_{1989}) - \\ln (Y_{1950}) = 39 \\cdot \\ln (1 + g) \\] which rearranges to: \\[ \\ln (1 + g) = \\frac{\\ln (Y_{1989}) - \\ln (Y_{1950})}{39} \\] and using our approximation: \\[ g \\approx \\frac{\\ln (Y_{1989}) - \\ln (Y_{1950})}{39} \\] In other words, log growth rates are good approximations for percentage growth rates. Calculating log growth rates for the data above, we get \\(g \\approx 0.0194\\) for the US and \\(g \\approx 0.0582\\) for Japan. The approximation is close for both. Plotting growth using the logarithm Recall that, with a constant growth rate \\(g\\) and starting from time 0, output in time \\(t\\) is: \\[Y_t = (1 + g)^t \\cdot Y_0\\] Taking natural logs of both sides, we have: \\[\\ln Y_t = \\ln Y_0 + t \\cdot \\ln (1 + g)\\] We see that log output is linear in time. Thus, if the growth rate is constant, a plot of log output against time will yield a straight line. Consequently, plotting log output against time is a quick way to eyeball whether growth rates have changed over time. Log Plot In figure 3.15 and 3.16 you see a semi-logarithmic plot that has one axis on a logarithmic scale and the other on a linear scale. It is useful for data with exponential relationships, where one variable covers a large range of values, or to zoom in and visualize that what seems to be a straight line in the beginning is, in fact, the slow start of a logarithmic curve that is about to spike, and changes are much bigger than thought initially.

The selected point of utility maximization must lie on the highest indifference curve that is consistent with the first condition. Optimal consumption These conditions ensure that the consumer selects the optimal bundle of goods that maximizes their utility while taking into account the constraints imposed by production capabilities or budget limitations. By analyzing production possibilities and individual preferences, economists gain insights into how consumers make choices, allocate resources, and achieve utility maximization. Understanding these concepts helps economists explore the trade-offs and decision-making processes that influence consumer behavior and shape market dynamics. If you are not familiar with the basic principles of the production possibility frontier curve, indifference curves, and budget constraints, I recommend referring to section 5.1 of the appendix for a comprehensive overview. This section provides a detailed explanation and exploration of these concepts. 4.1.1 The role of income and budget If income increases the budget constraint curve shifts outwards (to the right) as shown in figure 4.2. Impact of income change on consumption The utility-maximizing choice on the original budget constraint is M. The dashed horizontal and vertical lines extending through point M allow you to see at a glance whether the quantity consumed of goods on the new budget constraint is higher or lower than on the original budget constraint. On the new budget constraint, a choice like N will be made if both goods are normal goods. If good \\(x\\) is an inferior good, a choice like P will be made. If good \\(y\\) is an inferior good, a choice like Q will be made. 4.1.2 The role of prices If price of one good increases then the budget constraint curve. When the price rises, the budget constraint shifts in to the left for that good. Impact of price change on consumption The dashed lines make it possible to see at a glance whether the new consumption choice involves less of both goods, or less of one good and more of the other. The new possible choices would be good \\(x\\)’s and more good \\(y\\)’s, like point H, or less of both goods, as at point J. Choice K would mean that the higher price of good \\(x\\) led to exactly the same quantity of good \\(x\\) being consumed, but fewer of good \\(y\\). Choices like L are theoretically possible (if good \\(x\\) are giffen goods) but highly unlikely in the real world, because they would mean that a higher price for goods \\(x\\) means a greater quantity consumed of good \\(x\\). 4.1.3 Substitution and income effect When prices increase, individuals typically respond by reducing their consumption of the product with the higher price. This reaction is driven by two factors, both of which can occur simultaneously. Impact of income change on consumption The substitution effect occurs when a price change incentivizes consumers to consume less of a good with a relatively higher price and more of a good with a relatively lower price. The income effect stems from the fact that a higher price effectively reduces the purchasing power of income (even if actual income remains the same). This reduction in purchasing power leads to a decrease in the consumption of the good, particularly when the good is considered normal. Figure 4.4 illustrates the Hicksian decomposition for a price reduction of good \\(A\\), which affects the consumption of goods \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), shifting the consumption point from \\(C\\) to \\(D\\). The point \\(C&#39;\\) represents the hypothetical consumption point resulting from a rotated budget constraint that reflects the new price relationship. Exercise 4.1 The graphical foundations of demand curves A shift in the budget constraint means that when individuals are seeking their highest utility, the quantity that is demanded of that good will change. In this way, the logical foundations of demand curves—which show a connection between prices and quantity demanded—are based on the underlying idea of individuals seeking utility. In Figure 4.5, two points of consumption are displayed, illustrating the optimal choices made by customers when faced with prices \\(p_x^1&gt;p_x^2\\). The objective of this exercise is to graphically derive the demand function for good \\(x\\). To accomplish this, please provide a second two-dimensional plot below the existing graph, with the price of good \\(x\\), \\(p_x\\), represented on the y-axis. Graphical derivation of the demand function Exercise 4.2 Derivation of demand function using the Lagranian multiplier A representative consumer has on average the following utility function: \\(U=x y,\\) and faces a budget constraint of \\(B=P_{x} x+P_{y} y,\\) where \\(B, P_{x}\\) and \\(P_{y}\\) are the budget and prices, which are given.

This relationship highlights the trade-off between the two goods and their relative scarcity within a closed economy. Utility maximizing production: The production point that maximizes utility is where the PPF is tangent to the price relation, i.e. the terms of trade. This principle applies not only in a closed economy (autarky) but also under free trade (open economy). It implies that producers should allocate resources in a way that balances the trade-off between producing more of one good at the expense of another, while considering consumer preferences. Figure 4.1 depicts this. Exercise 4.4 Understanding indifference curves and budget constraints Which indifference curve in the figure on the right represents the highest utility level? Explain your decision. Suppose two goods are perfect substitutes. Draw the indifference curves for perfect substitutes. Suppose two goods are perfect complements. Draw the indifference curves for perfect complements. Suppose you have a fixed income \\(I=10\\) that you can spend on consuming two goods \\(x, y\\) at certain prices \\(p_x=1, p_y=1\\).

Using indifference curves, sketch what each consumer should consume to maximize utility. Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix.

Please find solutions to the exercise in Emerson (2019, ch. 4). 4.2 Markets under perfect competition Perfect competition is never found in the real world. However, it is a useful theoretical model that serves as a reference point for analyzing real-world markets. It provides valuable insights into market functioning and informs policymakers on how to address instances of market failure, where at least one assumption of perfect markets is not met. The assumptions of perfect markets and perfect competition, respectively, are: Many buyers and sellers: In a perfectly competitive market, there are numerous buyers and sellers, none of whom have a significant influence over market price. Each participant is a price taker, meaning they have no control over the price at which goods or services are exchanged. Homogeneous products: The products offered by all firms in a perfectly competitive market are identical or homogeneous. Consumers perceive no differences between the goods or services provided by different sellers. As a result, buyers base their purchase decisions solely on price. Perfect information: All buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market have complete and accurate information about prices, quality, availability, and other relevant factors. This assumption ensures that market participants can make rational decisions and respond efficiently to changes in market conditions. Free entry and exit: Firms can freely enter or exit the market in response to profits or losses. There are no barriers to entry or exit, such as legal restrictions or substantial costs, that prevent new firms from entering the market or existing firms from leaving it. Perfect mobility of factors of production: The resources used in production, such as labor and capital, can move freely between different firms and industries. There are no constraints on the mobility of factors of production, allowing firms to allocate resources efficiently. Profit maximization: All firms in a perfectly competitive market are profit maximizers. They aim to maximize their profits by adjusting their output levels based on prevailing market conditions. If firms can increase their profits, they will expand production, and if they incur losses, they will reduce output or exit the market. No externatlities: There are assumed to be no externalities, that is no external costs or benefits to third parties not involved in the transaction. These assumptions collectively define perfect competition and form the foundation of its analysis. If all conditions are fulfilled, there is no need for government regulation. Welfare is maximized and no pareto-improvement can be achieved. Theory would predict that if firms in an industry would make some profits, new firms will enter the market or existing firms would produce more which both yields an increase in supply. That, in turn, will drive down market prices until all firms earn zero profits and no more firms would have an incentive to enter the market. In the equilibrium, total revenue equals total cost. Thus, firms do not make profits. Firms can only make profits if they have some sort of competitive advantage and hence are not price takers which would be against assumption 1. The most extreme form of competitive advantage is a monopoly. It describes that one firm is the only provider of a certain good or service. This firm can set prices and the supply of the good and service completely. We will discuss that extreme case in the next section. 4.3 Monopoly A monopolist is a firm that is the only provider of a good or service. There is no close substitute to it. The ability of a monopolist to raise its price above the competitive level by reducing output is known as market power. This implies a loss of total welfare. In contrast with a perfectly competitive firm which faces a perfectly elastic demand (taking price as given), a monopolist faces the market demand. As a consequence, a monopolist has the power to set the market price. While we can consider a competitive firm as a price taker, a monopolist is price decision-maker or price setter. Firms that have to face fierce competition are more like price takers as they cannot set the price above the market price. If firms in perfect competition would set the price higher, all consumers would simply stop buying from that particular firm. That is not the case for a firm with market power, that is, a firm that has a product with unique features no other competitor has to offer. Revenue function There are two types of constraints that restrict the behavior of a monopolist (and any other firm): Technological constraints summarized in the cost function \\(C(x)\\). Demand constraints: \\(x(p)\\). Thus, we can write the revenue (or profit) function of the monopolist in two alternative ways: Either by using the demand function: \\[ \\pi(p) = px(p) - C(x(p)) \\] Or by using the inverse demand function: \\[ \\pi(x) = p(x)x - C(x) \\] The demand, \\(x(p)\\), and the inverse demand, \\(p(x)\\), represent the same relationship between price and demanded quantity from different points of view. The demand function is a complete description of the demanded quantity at each price, whereas the inverse demand gives us the maximum price at which a given output \\(x\\) may be sold in the market. Revenue and price relationship Thus, an increase in production by a monopolist has two opposing effects on revenue: A quantity effect: one more unit is sold, increasing total revenue by the price at which the unit is sold. A price effect: in order to sell the last unit, the monopolist must cut the market price on all units sold. This decreases total revenue. Price Effects and Revenue17 The two effects are shown in figure 4.7: At price \\(p_1\\), the total revenue is \\(p_1 \\cdot Q_1\\), which is represented by the areas A+B. At price \\(p_2\\), the total revenue is \\(p_2 \\cdot Q_2\\), which is represented by the areas A+C. Area A is the same for both, so the marginal revenue is the difference between B and C or C-B. Note that area C is the price, \\(p_2\\), times the change in quantity, \\(Q_2 - Q_1\\), or \\(p \\Delta Q\\); and area B is the quantity, \\(Q_1\\), times the change in price, \\(p_2 - p_1\\), or \\(\\Delta p \\cdot Q\\). Since \\(p_2 - p_1\\) is negative, the change in total revenue is C-B or: \\(\\Delta TR = p \\Delta Q + \\Delta p \\cdot Q\\). Dividing both sides by \\(\\Delta Q\\) gives us an expression for marginal revenue: \\[ MR = \\frac{\\Delta TR}{\\Delta Q} = \\underbrace{p}_{\\text{quantity effect}} + \\underbrace{Q \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta Q}}_{\\text{price effect}} \\] Profit-maximizing level of output To find the profit-maximizing price and quantity, respectively, we should look at the first-order conditions: \\[\\begin{align*} \\max_{p} \\pi (p) \\equiv&amp; \\max_{p} \\quad px(p) - C(x(p))\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\pi (p)}{\\partial p} =&amp; \\pi &#39; (p) = x(p) + px&#39;(p) - C&#39;(x(p))x&#39;(p) \\overset{!}{=} 0 \\end{align*}\\] or \\[\\begin{align*} \\max_{p} \\pi (x) \\equiv&amp; \\max_{x} \\quad p(x)x - C(x)\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\pi (x)}{\\partial x} =&amp; \\pi &#39; (p) = \\underbrace{p(x)}_{\\text{quantity effect}} + \\underbrace{xp&#39;(x)}_{\\text{price effect}} - C&#39;(x) \\overset{!}{=}&amp; 0\\\\ \\Rightarrow \\underbrace{p(x) + xp&#39;(x)}_{\\text{marginal revenue}} =&amp; \\underbrace{C&#39;(x)}_{\\text{marginal costs}}\\\\ \\Rightarrow MR =&amp; MC \\end{align*}\\] At the profit-maximizing level of output, marginal revenue equals marginal cost, that is, an infinitesimal change in the level of output changes revenue and cost equally. In other words, an infinitesimal increase in the level of output increases revenue and cost by the same amount, and an infinitesimal decrease in the level of output reduces revenue and cost by the same amount. Thus, we can determine a monopoly firm’s profit-maximizing price and output by following three steps: Determine the demand, marginal revenue, and marginal cost curves. Select the output level at which the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves intersect. Determine from the demand curve the price at which that output can be sold. Price effect of a monopoly Due to the price effect of an increase in output, the marginal revenue curve of a firm with market power always lies below its demand curve. So, a profit-maximizing monopolist chooses the output level at which marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue—not equal to price. As a result, the monopolist produces less and sells its output at a higher price than a perfectly competitive industry would. It earns a profit in the short run and the long run. Welfare Overall, the price-setting behavior of a monopolist is not good for overall welfare as figure 4.8 shows: The area of the monopoly profit and the consumer surplus, that is, the triangle above (600-B-1000), stands for total welfare. The triangle A-B-C is deadweight loss, that is, the welfare forgone because the monopolist supplies less goods at a higher price (MC=ATC) as compared to the scenario where many firms compete (MC=ATC). Price setting of a monopolist18 Price elasticity and market power We know that the demand elasticity of price can be measured with: \\[ \\frac{\\triangle p/\\bar{p}}{\\triangle x / \\bar{x}}. \\] Using differential calculus, the point-price elasticity of demand (PPD) can be written as: \\[ PPD = \\frac{\\partial p(x)}{\\partial x} \\cdot \\frac{x}{p(x)} \\] This can also be expressed as: \\[ PPD = p&#39;(x) \\frac{x}{p(x)} = x \\frac{p&#39;(x)}{p(x)} \\] Thus, if \\(PPD = 0\\), the price does not change if a single firm increases its quantity sold on the market. That means the firms are price takers, and their quantity sold has no impact on the price. If firms, however, have market power, \\(PPD &lt; 0\\), which means that if a firm increases the quantity on the market, the price must fall. The PPD can hence be interpreted as an indicator of the market power of firms. Marginal revenue and price elasticity Now, plugging the PPD into the MR function, we can show that MR is equal to zero when we have a unit demand elasticity, PPD, of \\(-1\\): \\[ MR = p(x) + xp&#39;(x) = p(x)\\left(1 + x\\frac{p&#39;(x)}{p(x)}\\right) = p(x)\\left(1 + PPD\\right) \\] Also see figure 4.9. In the monopoly output, marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal: \\[ MC = p(x) \\cdot \\left(1 + PPD\\right) \\] Price setting of a monopolist19 Lerner index The Lerner index is a measure of monopoly power, which equals the markup over marginal cost as a percentage of price. To obtain the Lerner index of monopoly power (or market power), let us rearrange \\(MC = p(x) \\cdot \\left(1 + PPD\\right)\\) as follows: \\[ \\frac{MC - p(x)}{p(x)} = PPD = \\text{Lerner Index} \\] If a firm does not have market power (\\(PPD = 0\\)), its price equals the marginal cost. When a firm’s market power is high (up to \\(|PPD| = \\infty\\)), the higher the markup that a firm sets. In perfect competition, since \\(p\\) and MC are equal, the Lerner Index is 0. A pure monopolist, on the other hand, can theoretically charge an infinite markup, which leads us to a Lerner index of 1.

It is important to actively fight discrimination whenever it is observed. However, the concept of discrimination takes a different form when it comes to price discrimination, which is a business practice involving the sale of the same goods at different prices to different buyers. This practice can be commonly seen in special offers tailored for students or retired individuals. One of the key factors utilized in price discrimination is the willingness to pay (WTP) of individuals. By charging a higher price to buyers with a higher WTP, a firm can maximize its profit. Moreover, and that is kind of surprising, it also comes with a increase in social welfare as is shown in figure 4.11 and figure 4.11. In 4.11, the monopolist charges the same price (PM) to all buyers. A deadweight loss results. In 4.11, however, the monopolist produces the competitive quantity but charges each buyer his or her WTP. This is called perfect price discrimination. The monopolist captures all consumer surplus as profit. But there is no deadweight loss. ![ Monopoly without price discrimination and welfare(fig/discrimination.png){ width=25% } ![ Monopoly with price discrimination and welfare(fig/discrimination2.png){ width=25% } In the real world, price discrimination is a common phenomenon, but achieving perfect price discrimination is highly challenging. This is primarily because no firm possesses complete knowledge of every buyer’s willingness to pay (WTP), and buyers typically do not disclose this information to sellers. Consequently, firms often divide customers into groups based on observables that are likely correlated with their WTP. 4.4 Von Thünen model of land use The classical model of spatial organization of the economy stems Heinrich von Thünen (1783-1850). The model focuses on agriculture as this was the dominant use of land at the time. However, the fundamental ideas of the model can be applied to various industries. The model can be described as follows: Assume a focal point of demand for agricultural goods (e.g., the marketplace of a large city). Differences in soil quality in the agricultural periphery of the considered city are neglected. The demand is differentiated. That means, various goods such as grains, dairy products, meat, timber, vegetables are required to satisfy the needs of the people. The goods differ in terms of the market price they can achieve, the assumed constant marginal production costs \\((c_i)\\), the revenue per unit of land, and in terms of their transportability, that is, each good has different specific transport costs \\((\\theta_i)\\). All mentioned variables are exogenously given. In particular, the model is based on the following assumptions: Point-centered demand for all goods \\(i\\). Different production methods possible, each with constant (marginal) production costs \\(c_i\\). Homogeneous Space: The agricultural land surrounding the central marketplace is assumed to be uniform and homogeneous in terms of soil fertility, climate, and other relevant factors. Given market prices for the individual products \\(p_i\\) Producers supply the market and have linear product-specific transportation costs \\((\\theta_i)\\). Perfect competition: The model assumes perfect competition among farmers for the available land (free market access). That implies that they have full knowledge of market conditions and make rational decisions. To analyze the model, let us start by considering the restriction to a single land use. The key idea is that the rent price for a unit of land arises from the net yield that this unit of land enables under that particular land use. However, since both production costs and distance-dependent transport costs need to be subtracted from the gross yield to determine the net yield, it follows that land rent is determined by the distance from the center. Under a given land use, the value of an agricultural area is significantly influenced by its distance from the marketplace. Formally, the land rent for land use for production of good \\(i\\), depending on the distance \\(x\\) from the marketplace, is given by: \\[ r_i(x) = q_i(p_i - c_i - \\theta_i \\cdot x) \\] The land rent increases with the quantity demanded \\((q)\\) and the price of the good, and it decreases with the marginal production costs \\((c)\\), the specific transportation costs \\((\\theta)\\), and the distance \\((x)\\) from the marketplace. The typical shape of a rent curve, with \\(r\\) on the y-axis and \\(x\\) on the x-axis, is a linearly decreasing curve. Its slope is determined by the expression \\(-q_i \\theta_i\\). Therefore, the steeper the specific transportation costs, the steeper the curve. Suppose, different land uses are allowed. By varying the price, revenue, and cost parameters in the equation above, different rent curves with varying locations and slopes emerge for different land uses. The interesting question now is: How high will the market rent be? Thünen provides a clear answer to this question: Competition among land tenants will ensure that in a specific distance zone around the center, the production method with the highest net yield in that zone will prevail. In other words, the market rent curve is the upper envelope of all rent curves for specific production methods. The situation is illustrated in figure 4.12 for three different production methods. The intersections of the market rent curves determine the shifts in production zones. Thünen’s rings of land use Exercise 4.8 Agricultural land use In the vicinity of an agglomeration center, four different agricultural land use forms are possible. We have information about the specific yield per unit of land \\(q_i\\), the (constant) marginal costs \\(c_i\\), the specific transportation costs \\(\\theta_i\\), and the price \\(p_i\\) that can be achieved for a unit of the respective product in the center. Where do we see which land use form? Production Form Production Form Production Form Production Form \\(i\\) 1 2 3 4 \\(q_i\\) 10 5 30 20 \\(p_i\\) 5 5 2 6 \\(c_i\\) 1 2 1 5 \\(\\theta_i\\) 0.4 0.1 0.15 0.05 Exercise 4.9 Business location model The Thünenian approach is intended to be applied to a business location model. The customer frequency, depending on the distance \\(x\\) from the center, can be approximated by the following function: \\[ f(x)_i = A_{0} e^{-a x} \\] The probability of sale per square meter for business type \\(i\\) is denoted by \\(\\lambda_i\\). The business types also differ in terms of profit margin and fixed costs. Describe the market rent curve and show which business type will dominate in each location. What effects does an increase in the parameter \\(a\\) have? What about an increase in \\(A_0\\)? Interpret the changes in parameters and the results from an economic perspective. 4.4.1 Launhardt/Hotelling location model Consider a scenario where two firms, i.e., \\(i={F1;F2}\\), have the option to establish their locations along a linear market, such as a street or a beach. These firms can relocate without incurring any costs and sell an identical product at the same price. Consequently, the only means of competition available to them is by strategically selecting their respective locations. Moreover, assume that customers are uniformly distributed throughout the market, and each customer is willing to purchase one unit of the product up to a certain price, denoted as \\(\\bar{p}\\). The cost of transportation is the same for both firms and is proportional to the distance between the firm and the customer. If we assume that the transportation costs are equal for both firms and that the market has a finite size, the firms will eventually position themselves at the center of the market with no empty space between them. The rationale and dynamics behind this behavior are clearly explained in the YouTube clip of TED-Ed Why do competitors open their stores next to one another? - Jac de Haan, see figure 4.13. I highly recommend watching the clip. YouTube clip of TED-Ed and Jac de Haan20 If we assume that the transportation costs can vary between the two firms, things became a bit more complicated. Let us define transportation costs for a firm as \\(\\theta_i=a_i d(x)\\), where \\(d(x)\\) represents the distance between the company and the respective costumer and \\(a_i\\) is firm-specific costs of transportation. Let us further assume competition and loosen the assumption of fixed prices: Firms can set prices but they need to charge the price of the good, \\(p\\), plus their costs of transporting the good to the costumer. Thus, the price of a good a firm needs to charge in order not to make deficits is \\[ p^{min}(x)=c+\\theta_i=c+a_i d(x) \\] If we assume that the transport costs are the same for both firms and that the market is limited in size, the firms will end up at the center of the market with no space inbetween them. However, there is always an incentive to deviate from that minimum of spatial differentiation. However, the dynamic is kind of strange as we can show in the following four figures.

These include: Production Possibility Frontier (PPF): I will explain how the PPF curve graphically visualizes the production and growth of firms and countries. Indifference curves: I will discuss how indifference curves represent different bundles of goods at which consumers are indifferent. Budget constraints: I will show you how to graphically sketch budget constraints, which play a significant role in consumer decision-making. Consumption choices: I will explore how the concepts of PPF, indifference curves, and budget constraints come together to explain consumer consumption choices. Competitive market prices: I will explain how prices on competitive markets are determined through the interaction of producers and consumers. 5.1.1 Production possibility frontier curve The production possibility frontier curve The production possibility frontier curve (PPF) as shown in figure 5.1 provides a graphical representation of all possible output options for two products when all available resources and factors of production are fully and efficiently utilized within a given time frame. The PPF serves as the boundary between combinations of goods and services that can be produced and those that cannot. The PPF is an invaluable tool for illustrating the implications of scarcity, as it offers insights into production efficiency, opportunity costs, and tradeoffs between different choices. Typically, the PPF exhibits concavity since not all factors of production can be used equally productive in all activities. Economic growth refers to the sustained expansion of production possibilities. An economy experiences growth through advancements in technology, enhancements in labor quality, or increases in capital quantity. As an economy`s resources increase, its production possibilities expand, causing the PPF to shift outward. It is worth noting that you can use the PPF to explain production in an “economy” or in a “firm”, respectively. Production efficiency arises when it is impossible to produce more of one good or service without producing less of another. When production occurs directly on the PPF, it signifies efficiency. On the other hand, if production takes place inside the PPF, there is potential to produce more goods without sacrificing any existing ones, indicating inefficiency. When production lies on the PPF, a tradeoff emerges because obtaining more of one good necessitates giving up some quantity of another. This tradeoff incurs a cost, known as an opportunity cost. Exercise 5.1 Understanding production Figure 5.2 shows a PPF and five conceivable production points, \\(C_i\\), where \\(i\\in \\{1,\\dots,5\\}\\). Explain the figure using the following terms: attainable point; available resources, unattainable, inefficient, efficient point. Production and different consumptions points What would happen to the PPF if the technology available in a country and needed for the production process became better? What would happen to the PPF if the resources available in a country and needed in the production process of both goods shrank? What would happen to the PPF if the resources (technology) available in a country that are needed in the production process\\(\\dots\\) \\(\\dots\\) for both goods increased (improved)? \\(\\dots\\) for good A shrank (got worse)? \\(\\dots\\) for good B increased (improved)? Does the shape of the PPF tell us anything about economies of scale in the production process? Figure 5.3 shows an extreme PPF. How can such a PPF be explained? Extreme production possibility frontier curve Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. 5.1.2 Indifference curves and Isoquants Indifference curve Combinations of two goods that yield the same level of utility for consumers are represented by indifference curves, see figure 5.4. These curves illustrate the various bundles of goods where consumers are equally satisfied. That means all points on an indifference curve represent the same level of utility. The shape of the indifference curve is determined by the underlying utility function, which captures the preferences of consumers for consuming different combinations of the two goods. The slope of an indifference curve indicates the rate at which the two goods can be substituted while maintaining the same level of utility for the consumer. Technically, the slope represents the marginal rate of substitution, which is equal to the absolute value of the slope. It measures the maximum quantity of one good that a consumer is willing to give up in order to obtain an additional unit of the other good. It is assumed that consumers aim to attain the highest possible indifference curve because a higher curve, located further to the right on a coordinate system, represents a higher level of utility. In figure 5.5 for example, \\(IC_1\\) represents a lower level of utility than \\(IC_2\\). Indifference curve Similar to the concept of indifference curves, an isoquant shows the combinations of factors of production that result in the same quantity of output. Figure 5.6: Perfect complements or substitutes Exercise 5.2 Isoquants Which of the two plots of figure 5.6 show isoquants when factors of production are perfect complements and perfect substitutes, respectively? Discuss the features of a Cobb-Douglas PF with respect to returns to scale and marginal product of production for both inputs. Sketch the total output curve in an output-\\(K\\) and an output-\\(L\\) quadrant. Sketch the isoquants for different levels of production. Please find solution to the exercise in the appendix. 5.1.3 Budget constraint In microeconomics, the concept of a budget constraint plays a vital role in understanding consumer decision-making and helps to analyze consumer choices and trade-offs. The budget constraint represents the limitations faced by consumers in allocating their limited income across different goods and services. The budget constraint indicates that the total expenditure on goods and services, calculated by multiplying the prices of each item by its corresponding quantity, must be less than or equal to the consumer’s income. Mathematically, the budget constraint can be expressed as: \\[ P_1 \\cdot Q_1 + P_2 \\cdot Q_2 + \\ldots + P_n \\cdot Q_n \\leq I \\] where \\(P_n\\) represent the prices of goods, \\(Q_n\\) denote the quantities of goods \\(n\\) consumed. \\(I\\) denotes the consumer’s income or their budget. Consumers strive to maximize their utility by selecting the optimal combination of goods and services within the constraints imposed by their limited income. This involves making decisions about how much of each good to consume while staying within the budgetary limits. The graphical representation of the ideal consumption point is depicted in Figure 5.7. By studying the budget constraint, economists can gain insights into consumer behavior, price changes, and the impact of income fluctuations on consumption patterns.

Therefore, \\(b\\) is the factor by which \\(f(x)\\) increases or decreases when \\(x\\) increases by one unit. For \\(b &gt; 1\\), the function \\(f(x)\\) is strictly increasing. For \\(0 &lt; b &lt; 1\\), the function \\(f(x)\\) is strictly decreasing. 5.2.2.2 The number \\(e\\) The most important base for exponential functions is the irrational number \\(e \\approx 2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995\\) It is sometimes called Euler’s number, after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1783). It can be expressed as: \\(e = \\sum \\limits _{n=0}^{\\infty }{\\frac {1}{n!}} = 1+{\\frac {1}{1}}+{\\frac {1}{1\\cdot 2}}+{\\frac {1}{1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3}}+\\cdots\\) \\(e^{x} = 1+{x \\over 1!}+{x^{2} \\over 2!}+{x^{3} \\over 3!}+\\cdots = \\sum _{n=0}^{\\infty }{\\frac {x^{n}}{n!}}\\) \\(e^k = \\lim _{n\\to \\infty }\\left(1+{\\frac {k}{n}}\\right)^{n}\\) Watch the YouTube clips Logarithms - What is e? | Euler’s Number Explained | Don’t Memorise by Infinity Learn Class 9&amp;10 (see figure 5.11) and What’s so special about Euler’s number e? | Chapter 5, Essence of calculus by 3Blue1Brown (see figure 5.12).

Forty-four ways to solve the puzzle21 Ten ways to fail in the puzzle22 There are 44 solutions and only 10 different ways to fail.

Here are the answers: PINGO Nobody came close to the correct probability. Solution to exercise 2.6: Optimal vs. satisfactory solution Collecting and analyzing the available information about a product is costly. It is also difficult to analyze the importance of product features for the intended purpose. Individuals often use rules of thumb to make a satisfactory decision. It is difficult to understand complex situations such as the market for financial products. For some people, it is simply not possible to find the best product in these complex markets. Consumers are often confronted with many variants of a product. The differences are negligible and therefore it is not worthwhile for consumers to analyze the situation in detail. Thus, they make a decision that may not be optimal, but they are satisfied with it. Solution to exercise 2.8: Lisa is pregnant At the beginning of the Inferential Statistics course at summer 2020, I also asked student this question.

Like most people, they decided that Lisa has a substantial chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. The test gets it right 86 percent of the time, right? That sounds rather reliable, doesn’t it? Well it does, but we should not rely on our feelings here and better do the math because the correct result would be that there is just a 1.7 percent chance of the baby having a Down syndrome. Now, let us proof the result that there is just a 1.7 percent chance of the baby having a Down syndrome using Bayesian Arithmetic which is explained in the following videos: Also, consider this interactive tool here: https://www.skobelevs.ie/BayesTheorem/ Let \\(A\\) be the event of the Baby has a Down syndrom and \\(B\\) the test is positive.

Possible consumption choices We now should calculate the utility of all 19 points, but only the red dots denote choices that may yield an optimal utility. The best utility is achieved when we buy 2 burgers and 3 drinks: \\[U=2^{0.6}3^{0.4}=2.35\\] Solve: \\[ \\mathcal{L}=B^{0.6}D^{0.4}-\\lambda(12-3B-2D) \\] FOC: \\[\\begin{align*} 12-3B+2D&amp;=0\\\\ 0.6B^{-0.4}D^{0.4}+3\\lambda&amp;=0\\\\ 0.4B^{0.6}D^{-0.6}+2\\lambda&amp;=0 \\end{align*}\\] Solving the second and third FOC for \\(\\lambda\\) and substituting \\(\\lambda\\) gives: \\[B=D\\] which we can plug into the first FOC to obtain: \\[B^*=2.4 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad D^*=2.4\\] Solution to exercise 3.4: Consumption choice \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathcal{L}&amp;=A^{0.8}B^{0.2}-\\lambda(30-6A-4B)\\\\ FOC: \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\lambda}&amp;=30-6A-4B=0 \\qquad (*)\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial A}&amp;=0.8A^{-0.2}B^{0.2}+6\\lambda=0 \\qquad (**)\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial B}&amp;=0.2A^{0.8}B^{-0.8}+4\\lambda=0 \\qquad (***) \\end{align*}\\] System of 3 equation with 3 unknowns can be solved in various ways.

Retrievability: Individuals’ assessments of event frequency are influenced by how easily information can be retrieved from memory. Insensitivity to Base Rates: Individuals tend to ignore the frequency of events in the general population and focus instead on specific characteristics of the events. Insensitivity to Sample Size: Individuals often fail to take sample size into account when assessing the reliability of sample information. Misconceptions of Chance: Individuals expect random processes to produce results that look “random” even when the sample size is too small for statistical validity. Regression to the Mean: Individuals fail to recognize that extreme events tend to regress to the mean over time. Conjunction Fallacy: Individuals often judge that the occurrence of two events together is more likely than the occurrence of either event alone. Confirmation Trap: Individuals tend to seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. Anchoring: Individuals often make estimates based on initial values, and fail to make sufficient adjustments from those values. Conjunctive- and Disjunctive-Events Bias: Individuals tend to overestimate the likelihood of conjunctive events (two events occurring together) and underestimate the likelihood of disjunctive events (either of two events occurring). Overconfidence: Individuals tend to be overconfident in the accuracy of their judgments, particularly when answering difficult questions. Hindsight and the Curse of Knowledge: After learning the outcome of an event, individuals tend to overestimate their ability to have predicted that outcome. Additionally, individuals often fail to consider the perspective of others when making predictions.

Not having clear investment goals: Too many investors focus on the latest investment fad or on maximizing short-term investment return instead of designing an investment portfolio that has a high probability of achieving their long-term investment objectives. Failing to diversify enough: The best course of action is to find a balance. Seek the advice of a professional adviser. Focusing on the wrong kind of performance: If you find yourself looking short term, refocus. Buying high and selling low: Instead of rational decision making, many investment decisions are motivated by fear or greed. Trading too much and too often: You should always be sure you are on track. Use the impulse to reconfigure your investment portfolio as a prompt to learn more about the assets you hold instead of as a push to trade. Paying too much in fees and commissions: Look for funds that have fees that make sense and make sure you are receiving value for the advisory fees you are paying. Focusing too much on taxes: It is important that the impetus to buy or sell a security is driven by its merits, not its tax consequences. Not reviewing investments regularly: Check in regularly to make sure that your investments still make sense for your situation and that your portfolio doesn’t need rebalancing. Taking too much, too little, or the wrong risk: Make sure that you know your financial and emotional ability to take risks and recognize the investment risks you are taking. Not knowing the true performance of your investments: Many investors do not know how their investments have performed in the context of their portfolio. You must relate the performance of your overall portfolio to your plan to see if you are on track after accounting for costs and inflation. Reacting to the media: Using the news channels as the sole source of investment analysis is a common investor mistake. Successful investors gather information from several independent sources and conduct their own proprietary research and analysis. Chasing yield: High-yielding assets can be seductive, but the highest yields carry the highest risks. Past returns are no indication of future performance. Focus on the whole picture and don’t get distracted while disregarding risk management. Trying to be a market timing genius: Market timing is very difficult and attempting to make a well-timed call can be an investor’s undoing. Consistently contributing to your investment portfolio is often better than trying to trade in and out in an attempt to time the market. Not doing due diligence: Check the training, experience, and ethical standing of the people managing your money. Ask for references and check their work on the investments they recommend. Taking the time to do due diligence can help avoid fraudulent schemes and provide peace of mind. Working with the wrong adviser: An investment adviser should share a similar philosophy about investing and life in general. The benefits of taking extra time to find the right adviser far outweigh the comfort of making a quick decision. Letting emotions get in the way: Investing can bring up significant emotional issues that can impede decision-making. A good adviser can help construct a plan that works no matter what the answers to important financial questions are. Forgetting about inflation: It’s important to focus on real returns after accounting for fees and inflation. Even if the economy is not in a massive inflationary period, some costs will still rise, so it’s important to focus on what you can buy with your assets, rather than their value in dollar terms. Neglecting to start or continue: Investment management requires continual effort and analysis to be successful. It’s important to start investing and continue to invest over time, even if you lack basic knowledge or have experienced investment losses. Not controlling what you can: While you can’t control what the market will bear, you can control how much money you save. Continually investing capital over time can have as much influence on wealth accumulation as the return on investment and increase the probability of reaching your financial goals.

Solution to exercise 3.18: Net present value Assuming that the cash flows occur at the end of each year, we can use the following formula to calculate the NPV of the project: \\[ NPV = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n} - C_0 \\] \\[ NPV_A = -50,000 + \\frac{20,000}{(1 + 0.08)^1} + \\frac{20,000 }{ (1 + 0.08)^2} + \\frac{20,000 }{ (1 + 0.08)^3} + \\frac{20,000 }{ (1 + 0.08)^4} + \\frac{20,000 }{ (1 + 0.08)^5} \\] \\[ NPV_A = -50,000 + 18,518.52 + 17,146.77 + 15,876.64 + 14,700.59 + 13,611.66 \\approx 29,854 \\] \\[ NPV_B = -50,000 + \\frac{100,000 }{ (1 + 0.08)^5} = -50,000+68058,31\\approx 18058 \\] Since the \\(NPV_A&gt;NPV_B\\), we should invest in project A. Solution to exercise 3.19: Internal rate of return Assuming that the cash flows occur at the end of each year, we can use the following formula to calculate the IRR of the project: \\[ 0 = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\frac{C_n}{(1+IRR)^n} \\] \\[ 0 = -50,000 + \\frac{20,000}{(1 + IRR)^1} + \\frac{20,000 }{ (1 + IRR)^2 } + \\frac{20,000 }{ (1 + IRR)^3 } + \\frac{20,000 }{ (1 + IRR)^4 } + \\frac{20,000 }{ (1 + IRR)^5 } \\] Solving for \\(IRR\\) is not that easy. Using a spreadsheet program, we get \\(IRR_A\\approx 28.68%\\) and \\(IRR_B\\approx 14.87%\\). Thus, project A seems to be better. Solution to exercise 3.20: Rule of 70 What is the time required for a growing variable to double? Let \\(X\\) be the initial value of a growing variable, and \\(Y\\) denote the terminal value at time \\(t + n\\). The relationship between the two is given by \\[Y = X(1+g)^n\\] where \\(g\\) is the annual growth rate. As we are interested in the time span required for \\(X\\) to double, \\(Y = 2\\), and \\[2 = (1+g)^n\\] Taking natural logarithms (logarithm to the base of \\(e\\)), we get \\[\\ln 2 = n \\ln (1+g)\\] and hence \\[n = \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\ln (1+g)} \\quad (*).\\] This is the exact number of time periods required for a growing variable to double its size. One can approximate \\(n\\) using the definition of \\(e^x\\): \\[e^x = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\ldots + \\frac{x^n}{n!} + R_n\\] where the remainder term \\(R_n \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\). Ignoring high-order terms, for small \\(x\\), it may be approximated by \\[e^x \\approx 1 + x\\] Taking logarithms of both sides, we get \\[x \\approx \\ln (1 + x) \\quad (**).\\] Using (**), equation (*) may be approximated as \\[n \\approx \\frac{\\ln 2}{g} = \\frac{0.693147}{g} \\approx \\frac{70}{g\\%}\\] This is the origin of the Rule of 70. Using the number \\(e\\) right away is simpler: \\[\\begin{align*} (e^r)^t &amp;= 2 \\\\ \\ln e^{rt} &amp;= \\ln 2 \\\\ rt &amp;= \\ln 2 \\\\ t &amp;= \\frac{\\ln 2}{r} \\\\ t &amp;\\approx \\frac{0.693147}{r} \\end{align*}\\] Solution to exercise 3.21: Investments over time The formula under discrete time is: \\[ Y_t=Y_0\\cdot (1+g)^t \\] The formula under continuous time is: \\[ Y_t=Y_0\\cdot e^{gt} \\] Solution to exercise 3.22: Exponential growth Figure @ref(fig:expgrowth_graphs) provides the solution.

Task solved in class. Task solved in class. The budget line can be sketched into a y-x plot by solving \\(p_xx+p_yy=I\\) for y: \\[y=\\frac{I}{p_y}-\\frac{p_x}{p_y}x\\] Solution to exercise 5.2: Isoquants Graph (1) shows perfect complements and graph (2) perfect substitutes. The isoquants for Cobb-Douglas production functions is convex and in between the two extremes and it shifts outward with more production. Solution to exercise 3.3: Labor and machines Set up Lagrangian: \\[\\mathcal{L} = K^{0.4}L^{0.6} - 216\\lambda + 2\\lambda L + 8\\lambda K\\] FOC: \\[\\begin{align*} 0 &amp;= 0.4K^{-0.6}L^{0.4} - 8\\lambda \\quad (*) \\\\ 0 &amp;= 0.6K^{0.4}L^{-0.4} - 2\\lambda \\quad (**) \\\\ 0 &amp;= 216 - 2L - 8K \\quad (***) \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] Solving (*) and (**) for \\(\\lambda\\) and substituting \\(\\lambda\\) gives us: \\[\\frac{1}{6}L = K \\quad (****)\\] Plugging (****) into (***) yields: \\[0 = 216 - 2L - 8\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{6}L\\right) \\Rightarrow L = 64\\frac{4}{5}\\] Using that result in (***) again, we get: \\[216 - 2\\cdot 64\\frac{4}{5} + 8K \\Rightarrow K = 10\\frac{4}{5}\\] Thus, the optimal combination of inputs is \\(L = 64\\frac{4}{5}\\) and \\(K = 10\\frac{4}{5}\\). Solution to exercise 4.6: Marginal revenue and total revenue See: chapter 15.2 Profit Maximization for Monopolists of Emerson (2019), see: here. Solution to exercise 4.7: Title \\(PED=\\frac{17}{31} \\approx 0.5483\\) The demand function can be derived using the point-slope formula and one sales point: \\[P-40=-\\frac{1}{10}(Q-800) \\Rightarrow P=120-\\frac{1}{10}Q \\Rightarrow Q=1200-10P\\] Total costs (TC) are given by \\(TC=FC+VC=FC+MC \\cdot Q\\). Solving the system of equations: \\[26500=FC+750 \\cdot MC\\] \\[28000=FC+800 \\cdot MC\\] we find \\(MC=30\\) and \\(FC=4000\\). The cost function is \\(TC=4000+30 \\cdot Q\\). The revenue function is given by \\(TR=P \\cdot Q(P)\\). Plugging the demand function in gives: \\[TR(Q)=120Q-\\frac{1}{10}Q^2\\] The marginal revenue function is \\(\\frac{TR(Q)}{\\partial Q}=120-\\frac{2}{10}Q\\). The marginal cost function is \\(MC=30\\) (as found in step 3). Setting \\(MC=MR\\), we find the optimal quantity: \\[30=120-\\frac{2}{10}Q \\Rightarrow Q^*=450\\] Plugging \\(Q^*\\) into the demand function, we find the optimal price: \\(P^*=120-\\frac{1}{10} \\cdot 450 = 75\\) Profit (\\(\\pi\\)) is given by \\(\\pi=TR-TC\\): \\[\\pi_{t=1}=1200 \\cdot 45-10 \\cdot 45^2-4000-30 \\cdot 750 = 7250\\] \\[\\pi_{t=2}=1200 \\cdot 40-10 \\cdot 40^2-4000+30 \\cdot 800 = 4000\\] \\[\\pi_{t=3}=1200 \\cdot 75-10 \\cdot 75^2-4000+30 \\cdot 450 = 16250\\] Taken from https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_vom_Nikolaus↩︎ Taken from https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haus_vom_Nikolaus↩︎ "],["references.html", "References", " References Solution to exercise 5.1: Understanding production Any point that lies either on the production possibilities curve or to the left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Production points that lie in the yellow shaded area are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. These points represent an inefficient production, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other. The PPF would shift outwards. The PPF would shift inwards. The PPF would shift… …outwards for both goods. …inwards for good A, see figure 6.5. …outwards for good B. With economies of scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the opportunity cost of one good falling as more of it is produced. A straight-line (linear) PPF reflects a situation where resources are not specialized and can be substituted for each other with no added cost. With constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if there was only one factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. Here is one example: Suppose a country that is endowed with two factors of production and that one factor can only be used for producing good A and the other factor can only be used to produce good B. Shrinking production possibilities in good A Solution to exercise 5.3: Calculate with log \\(\\log_2 16=4\\) because \\(2^4=16\\) \\(\\log_3 243=5\\) because \\(3^5=243\\) \\(\\log_5 125=3\\) because \\(5^3=125\\) \\(\\log_3 81=4\\) because \\(3^4=81\\) \\(\\log_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)=-3\\) because \\(2^{-3}=\\frac{1}{8}\\) Anon, (University. of M.
