Learning in small increments is more effective than last-minute cramming.\nTest yourself with past exams that you find in the appendix.\nIf you have the opportunity to form a study group, make use of it.

    "text": "1.2 What is managerial economics for ChatGPT?\n\n1.2.1 Me: Define managerial economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT (4.0):\n\n\n\nManagerial economics is a discipline that combines economic theory with managerial practice. It helps in analyzing business situations and decision-making processes within an organization. By applying microeconomic principles and tools, managerial economics aids managers in planning, optimizing resource use, forecasting future conditions, and making strategic decisions that enhance the organization’s performance. It encompasses various aspects of both economics and business, such as demand analysis, production and cost functions, pricing strategies, risk analysis, and capital budgeting.\nKey areas of focus in managerial economics include:\nDemand Analysis and Forecasting: Understanding consumer behavior and predicting future market trends to make informed decisions.\nProduction and Cost Analysis: Evaluating the production process and cost functions to optimize efficiency and reduce expenses.\nPricing Decisions: Developing pricing strategies that maximize profits while remaining competitive in the market.\nProfit Management: Analyzing profit margins and identifying ways to increase overall profitability.\nRisk and Uncertainty Analysis: Assessing and managing risks associated with business decisions.\nCapital Budgeting: Making decisions about long-term investments and capital expenditures.\nOverall, managerial economics provides a framework for systematically thinking about business decisions and executing strategies to achieve organizational objectives.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Me: What distinguishes managerial economics from Microeconomics and Macroeconomics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT (4.0):\n\n\n\nManagerial economics, microeconomics, and macroeconomics are all subfields of economics, but they differ in their focus, scope, and application. Here’s how they are distinguished from one another:\nManagerial Economics\nScope and Focus:\nOrganizational Level: Primarily focuses on the firm or organization, aiming to solve specific managerial and business problems.\nDecision-Making: Applies economic theories and principles to managerial decision-making processes, such as pricing, production, costs, and resource allocation.\nPractical Application: Designed to be directly applicable by managers for optimizing business operations and strategic planning.\nMicroeconomics\nScope and Focus:\nIndividual and Firm Level: Concentrates on the behaviors of individuals, households, and firms.\nMarket Mechanisms: Studies how these entities interact within markets, how prices are determined, and how resources are allocated.\nTheoretical Framework: Provides the underlying theories that explain demand and supply, elasticity, consumer behavior, production, and costs.\nMacroeconomics\nScope and Focus:\nEconomy-Wide Perspective: Looks at the entire economy rather than individual units.\nAggregate Indicators: Studies large-scale economic factors such as national income, unemployment rates, inflation, GDP, and overall economic growth.\nPolicy Implications: Often deals with government policies, monetary and fiscal policy, and their impact on the economy as a whole.\nKey Differences\nScale:\nManagerial Economics: Focuses on optimizing decisions within individual firms or organizations.\nMicroeconomics: Explores the behavior of individual agents such as consumers and firms.\nMacroeconomics: Examines aggregate economic variables and economy-wide phenomena.\nApplication:\nManagerial Economics: Directly used by managers to make practical business decisions.\nMicroeconomics: Provides foundational theories that inform both managerial economics and broader economic policies.\nMacroeconomics: Used by policymakers to shape economic policy and understand economic fluctuations on a national or global scale.\nObjective:\nManagerial Economics: Goal-oriented towards improving organizational efficiency and profitability.\nMicroeconomics: Aims to understand the fundamental aspects of supply and demand and market mechanisms.\nMacroeconomics: Seeks to explain economic trends and issues that affect the economy as a whole.\nIn essence, while managerial economics draws heavily from microeconomic theories, it is distinct in its focus on practical application within firms. Macroeconomics, on the other hand, operates at a higher level of abstraction, dealing with broad economic indicators and policies.",

    "text": "1.3 What is economics?\nAll economic questions arise because we want more than we can get. Our inability to satisfy all our wants is called scarcity and because of scarcity, we must make choices that depend on the incentives we face. An incentive is a reward that encourages or a penalty that discourages an action.\nEconomics is a social science, and as in all social sciences, many of the terms used in it are poorly defined. The following quotes can demonstrate that:\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes (1883-1946): “The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps it possessors to draw correct conclusions.” Keynes (1921)\n\nKeynes, J. M. (1921). Money. In D. H. Robertson, Money (Cambridge Economic Handbooks). Cambridge Economic Handbooks.\n\n\nAlfred Marshall (1842-1924): “Economics is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life; it examines that part of individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of the material requisites of wellbeing.” Marshall (2009, p. 1)\n\nMarshall, A. (2009). Principles of economics: Unabridged eighth edition. Cosimo, Inc.\n\n\nGary S. Becker (1930-2014): “Economics is all about how people make choices. Sociology is about why there isn’t any choice to be made.” Becker (1960, p. 233)\n\nBecker, G. S. (1960). An economic analysis of fertility. In G. S. Becker (Ed.), Demographic and economic change in developed countries. Princeton University Press.\n\n\nColander (2006, p. 4): “Economics is the study of how human beings coordinate their wants and desires, given the decision-making mechanisms, social customs, and political realities of the society.”\n\nColander, D. C. (2006). Economics (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill Irvin.\n\n\nParkin (2012, p. 2): “Economics is the social science that studies the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and entire societies make as they cope with scarcity and the incentives that influence and reconcile those choices.”\n\n\nGwartney et al. (2006, p. 5.): “[E]conomics is the study of human behavior, with a particular focus on human decision making.”\n\nGwartney, J. D., Stroup, R. L., Sobel, R. S., & MacPherson, D. A. (2006).

A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.\n\nGreenlaw, S.

[…] Macroeconomics is the study of the performance of the national economy and the global economy.”\n\nParkin, M. (2012). Economics (10th ed.). Addison-Wesley.\n\nAlthough many textbook definitions are quite similar in many ways, the lack of agreement on a clear-cut definition of economics does not really matter and does not necessarily pose a problem as\n\n“[E]conomists are generally guided by pragmatic considerations of what works or by methodological views emanating from various sources, not by formal definitions.” Backhouse & Medema (2009, p. 231)\n\nBackhouse, R. E., & Medema, S. G. (2009). Retrospectives: On the definition of economics.

Decision-making is the process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the values, preferences and beliefs of the decision-maker. Every decision-making process produces a final choice, which may or may not prompt action.

    "section": "2.2 How to characterize decisions",
    "text": "2.2 How to characterize decisions\nDecision making is a process of investing time and effort to make a decision that leads to a results. Before we talk about the results, let’s discuss some (stereo) types of decisions that can help to design an appropriate decision making process. Using stereotypes and categorizations can be beneficial as they simplify complexities and provide guidance. For example, we often employ stereotypes to appropriately engage with others. When encountering a person dressed formally, it is generally advisable to approach them in a professional manner, even when uncertain of their preferences. In this case, our prior experiences help guide our behavior based on stereotypes.\nAccording to Fitzgerald (2002, p. 9f) decisions can be roughly divided into two generic types:\n\nRoutine decisions: Decisions that must be made at regular intervals.\nNon-routine: Unique, random, non-recurring decision situations.\n\nAnother common method of dividing decisions into two categories is as follows:\n\nOperative decisions: This type of decision usually involves day-to-day business operations. There is a lot of overlap with the routine category here. Examples of this type of decision include\n\nsetting production levels,\ndetermining employee work shifts for the upcoming week to ensure adequate coverage,\ncoordinating daily delivery routes for distributing products to customers,\ndeciding to stop production or fix a problem if quality standards are not met during routine inspections, or, when it comes to decisions in our daily lives,\nwhere, what, when, and what to eat for lunch.\n\nStrategic decisions: These decisions typically concern long-term company policies and direction. Examples include\n\nentering a new market or exiting an industry,\nchoosing a corporate design, or\nacquiring a competitor.\nIn our personal lives, a strategic decision might be choosing between renting an apartment near the university or commuting from our parents’ home.\n\n\nPeople often distinguish between decisions at work and private decisions. Private decisions affect fewer people on average, but usually the people involved are closer to you personally. However, both types of decisions involve the same things such as people (human resources), money (budgeting), buying and selling (marketing), how we do something (operations) or how we want to do it in the future (strategy and planning).\nSome decisions are more important than others because the potential impact of a decision varies, that is, the scope of a decision. For example, decisions can affect one person or millions, one pound/dollar or millions, one product/service or an entire market, one day or ten years, etc.\nHowever, it is not entirely clear how to validate the scope. It depends heavily on the perspective of the decision-maker. For a small company, for example, an investment of 10,000 euros may be a big decision, while for a multinational cooperation it is a drop in the ocean. So the scope for decisions is relative, not absolute. It depends entirely on the context in which the decision is made and on the characteristics of the person(s) making it.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Conditions of decision making\n\n\n\nSource: CEOpedia (2021)\n\nCEOpedia. (2021). Rational decision making. Accessed March 11, 2023. https://ceopedia.org/index.php/Rational_decision_making\n\n\n\nThere are three general conditions (see Figure 2.7) that determine the design of the optimal decision making process:\n\nCertainty: A condition under which taking a decision involves reasonable degree of certainty about its result, what are the opportunities and what conditions accompany this decision.\nRisk: A condition under which taking a decision involves reasonable degree of certainty about its result, what are the opportunities and what conditions accompany this decision.\nUncertainty: A condition in which decision maker does not know all the choices, as well as risks associated with each of them and possible consequences.",

    "text": "2.3 Rationality\n\n2.3.1 The rational model\nA choice can be considered as a rational one when a individual decides for the best alternative courses of action. That is, the alternative with the greatest benefit over cost for the individual making the choice. Whatever the benefits and the costs maybe, a decision maker has to consider all and make a decision. Of course, in reality it is often difficult if not impossible to sum up benefits and costs as the nature of both may be totally different. That is what makes decision often so difficult.\nThe nature of costs and benefits is manifold and emotions in general are hard to quantify and take as a basis for a decision. To deal with that economists use a theoretical concept that measures everything in utility. That is a general and abstract measure to model worth or value. Its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or happiness within the theory of utilitarianism. For example, it represents the satisfaction or pleasure that people receive for consuming a bundle of goods and services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Rational decision\n\n\n\nA rational decision is the result of a logical and systematic process in which the decision-maker evaluates\n\nall relevant and available information about\nall possible courses of action (a.k.a., alternatives) and\nall their potential outcomes,\n\naiming to choose the option that maximizes utility, where utility increases with benefits and decreases with costs.\n\n\nThe rational model assumes that actors always act in a way that maximizes their utility (as consumers) and profit (as producers) and that they are capable of arbitrarily complex considerations. This means that they consider all possible outcomes and choose the course of action that leads to the best result. In economics, this is known as the homo economicus assumption, which is a paraphrase of the assumption of perfect rationality. Of course, this assumption is highly idealized, and it is doubtful that any serious economist has ever believed it to be completely true in reality. It is important to understand the limitations of this assumption in order to make good decisions. Therefore, we will discuss the limitations in detail later. All in all, it is a useful assumption that is indispensable in theoretical research and simplifies many things in practical analysis. It makes it possible to make predictions and explain behavior to a certain extent.\nHere is an example of a logical and systematic sequence of steps for making a decision, as outlined similarly by Fitzgerald (2002, p. 13):\n\nClearly identify the problem. A problem is defined as the perceived gap between the current situation and the desired outcome.\nGenerate potential solutions. For routine decisions, various alternatives can be easily identified using established decision rules. However, non-routine decisions require a creative process to discover new alternatives.\nSelect a solution. Using appropriate analytical approaches, choose the alternative with the highest expected value. In decision theory, this is referred to as maximizing the expected utility of the outcomes.\nImplement the solution. Successful implementation requires ensuring that those responsible understand and accept their roles, and have the necessary motivation and resources for success.\nEvaluate and improve. Assess the effectiveness of the decision and refine the process for future improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3 Poor and irrational decisions\nPeople make poor decisions all the time. They smoke, take drugs, and harm themself in various ways, make seemingly stupid things that they regret instantaneously. Do all these people act irrational? And, what is a poor decision? What is a stupid thing? The more you think about all that the more challenging it becomes to stay within a logically consistent framework where the meaning of words doesn’t change.\nDiscuss whether taking drugs can be considered a rational choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking drugs are usually considered to be a “stupid” idea because drugs (if not taken for medical purpose) usually don’t solve problems and causes addiction and bad side effects. However they may give some sort of relieve for some short period of time. Thus, taking drugs can be considered as a rational choice for people that have strong time preferences (i.e., people that can’t take the (emotional) pain now and want to postpone it), don’t fear side effects, and have little or no hope that things will get better later or that taking any other alternative would help them solving their problem. For those people it is, at least from their perspective, a rational choice.\nOverall, I would tend to argue that taking drugs can be a rational choice if these individuals consider all (!) alternative and all (!) information available and if they analyze all (!) relevant aspects without a bias.\nIf all that hold, we can disagree and we can try our best to convince these individuals that there are better alternative courses of action. Of course, we can and I believe, we should support those human beings not taking drugs. For example, we can teach them to be more optimistic and hence weight the chances that problems can be solved better. However, we cannot claim that their decision is irrational given the conditions mentioned above hold.\nOften the conditions to not hold as desperate people are not capable to use all the information without a bias. This gives bystanders such as relatives, friends, and other authorities the legitimate to interfere. For example, doctors and national authorities can send people that are not capable to act rational to a psychological institute until they have the ability to rationally make a decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Irrationality\nWhile the rational model is useful, it can also be criticized in a number of ways. One key misconception is that managers always optimize their decisions through rationality, consciously selecting and implementing the best alternatives. However, this belief rests on several questionable assumptions, as outlined by Fitzgerald (2002, p. 13):\n\nFitzgerald, S. P. (2002). Decision making. Capstone Publishing.\n\nIt is rarely possible to know in advance all possible alternative solutions and predict their specific outcomes.\nThe assumption that there is always an optimal solution among the identified alternatives may not hold true.\nAccurately and numerically weighting the alternatives, their outcome probabilities, and the relative desirability of these outcomes is often impractical.\nDecision-makers are not always purely rational; emotions, biases, and organizational politics frequently influence the process.\nBusiness decisions are not exclusively driven by the desire to maximize profits.\n\nThe rational model is considered normative because it prescribes a strict, logical sequence of steps to follow in any decision-making process. It is based on the assumption that human behavior is logical and therefore predictable in certain conditions. However, this doesn’t always reflect real-world decision-making. For example, findings from behavioral economics reveal that the concept of homo economicus, while useful, is flawed in several key aspects.\nAfter all, what would happen if economics adopted the opposite extreme, assuming individuals act irrationally? If actors behaved randomly and unpredictably, we would struggle to make any predictions, and the future would resemble a random walk. Science itself would become meaningless and unnecessary.\nClearly, the extreme of irrationality isn’t a viable alternative. So, what can we do? We can identify, explain, and account for the limitations of the homo economicus assumption in both theory and empirical analysis. Economists, and anyone applying or studying economic theories, should be aware of the pitfalls in human decision-making and recognize that our ability to act rationally is often limited.\n\n\n2.3.3 Bounded rationality\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Herbert A. Simon\n\n\n\n\n(#fig:simon)\n\n\n\nSource: Picture is taken from Nobel Foundation archive.\n\n\n\nHerbert A. Simon (1916-2001) shown in figure Figure 2.8 received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1978 and the Turing Award1 in 1975. According to NobelPrize.org (2021), he\n1 The Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field. It is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and is known as or often referred to as `Nobel Prize of Computing’.\nNobelPrize.org. (2021). Herbert A. Simon: facts [{Nobel Prize Outreach AB} 2021.]. Accessed March 11, 2023. https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1978/simon/facts\n\n“combined different scientific disciplines and considered new factors in economic theories. Established economic theories held that enterprises and entrepreneurs all acted in completely rational ways, with the maximization of their own profit as their only goal. In contrast, Simon held that when making choices all people deviate from the strictly rational, and described companies as adaptable systems, with physical, personal, and social components. Through these perspectives, he was able to write about decision-making processes in modern society in an entirely new way”.\n\nIn particular, he proposed bounded rationality as an alternative basis for the mathematical and neoclassical economic modelling of decision-making, as used in economics, political science, and related disciplines.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Bounded rationality\n\n\n\nSource: https://thedecisionlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bounded-Rationality.jpg.\n\n\n\nBounded rationality proposes that decision making is constrained by managers’ ability to process information, i.e., the rationally is bounded (see figure Figure 2.9). Managers use shortcuts and rules of thumb which are based on their prior experience with similar problems and scenarios. Given the constraints of managers in their position, they do not actually optimize their choice given the available information. It is more like finding a satisfactory solution, not necessarily the best or the optimal solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.4 Optimal vs. satisfactory solution\nUsing the images @ref(fig:picA) to @ref(fig:picD), explain the idea of bounded rationality in the context of decision making.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: The idea of bounded rationality\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollecting and analyzing the available information about a product is costly. It is also difficult to analyze the importance of product features for the intended purpose.\nIndividuals often use rules of thumb to make a satisfactory decision.\nIt is difficult to understand complex situations such as the market for financial products. For some people, it is simply not possible to find the best product in these complex markets.\nConsumers are often confronted with many variants of a product. The differences are negligible and therefore it is not worthwhile for consumers to analyze the situation in detail. Thus, they make a decision that may not be optimal, but they are satisfied with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.5 Are we irrational?\nDiscuss the following statement:\n\nSince the rationality of individuals is bounded and it is obvious that individuals do not make optimal decisions, we can say that individuals act irrationally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Heuristics\nIn real life, we frequently rely on heuristics to solve problems and make decisions. A heuristic is any approach to solving a problem that uses a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational. However, a heuristic should–at best–be sufficient to achieve an immediate, short-term goal or approximation. Overall, people use heuristics because they either cannot act completely rationally or want to act rationally but do not have the time it would take to compute the perfect solution. Moreover, the effort is probably not worth it or simply not possible given the time constraints under which the problem must be solved. A heuristic is a mental shortcut or rule of thumb to make decisions and solve problems quickly and efficiently. It helps individuals to arrive at a solution without extensive analysis or evaluation of all available information. Heuristics are usefull when time, resources, or information are limited.\nWhile heuristics can be helpful in many situations, they can also lead to errors and biases, particularly when they are overused or misapplied. We will discuss some of these biases in ?sec-cognitive-biases in greater detail.",

A famous version stems from Paulo Coelho^[See https://paulocoelhoblog.com and it goes like this:\n\nOne day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish.\nAbout that time, a businessman came walking down the beach, trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family. “You aren’t going to catch many fish that way”, said the businessman to the fisherman.\n“You should be working rather than lying on the beach!” The fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, “And what will my reward be?” “Well, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!” was the businessman’s answer. “And then what will my reward be?” asked the fisherman, still smiling. The businessman replied, “You will make money and you’ll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish!” “And then what will my reward be?”” asked the fisherman again.\nThe businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman’s questions. “You can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!” he said. “And then what will my reward be?” repeated the fisherman. The businessman was getting angry. “Don’t you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!”\nOnce again the fisherman asked, “And then what will my reward be?” The businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, “Don’t you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won’t have a care in the world!”\nThe fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, “And what do you think I’m doing right now?”\n\nDefine the cost and benefits of both persons. Who do you think has a better life overall. Who is acting rationally here? In other words, who is maximizing utility here? The fishermen or the businessmen? Both? None?",

    "text": "3.1 Basics\nDecision making under uncertainty assumes that we are fully unaware of the future state of nature. A state of nature (or simply “state”) refers to the set of external factors that are relevant to the decision maker.\nA payoff table, also known as a decision matrix, can be a helpful tool for decision making, as shown in the table below. It presents the available alternatives denoted by \\(A_i\\), along with the possible future states denoted by \\(N_j\\).\nThe payoff or outcome depends on both the chosen alternative and the future state of nature that occurs. For instance, if alternative \\(A_i\\) is chosen and state of nature \\(N_j\\) occurs, the resulting payoff is \\(O_{ij}\\). Our goal is to choose the alternative \\(A_i\\) that yields the most favorable outcome \\(O_{ij}\\).\nThe payoff is a numerical value that represents either profit, cost, or more generally, utility (benefit) or disutility (loss).\nIf we assume that all states are independent from each other and that we are certain about the state of nature, the decision is straightforward: just go for the alternative with the best outcome for each state of nature. However, most real-world scenarios are not that simple because most states of nature are more complex and needs further to be considered.\nIf a decision should be made under risks, then we have some information about the probability that certain states appear. A decision under uncertainty simple means we have no information, that is, no probabilities.",

    "section": "3.2 Decision making under certainty",
    "text": "3.2 Decision making under certainty\nWhen a decision must be made under certainty, the state of nature is fully known, and the optimal choice is to select the alternative with the highest payoff. However, determining this payoff can be complex, as it may be the result of a sophisticated function involving multiple variables.\nFor example, imagine you need to choose between four different restaurants (\\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), \\(a_4\\)). Each restaurant offers a unique combination of characteristics, such as the quality of the food (\\(k_1\\)), the quality of the music played (\\(k_2\\)), the price (\\(k_3\\)), the quality of the service (\\(k_4\\)), and the overall environment (\\(k_5\\)). The corresponding payoff Table 3.2 assigns a numerical value to each characteristic, with higher numbers indicating better quality.\nIn this scenario, \\(a_i\\) represents the different restaurant options, \\(k_i\\) refers to specific characteristics of each restaurant, and the numbers in the table indicate the payoffs associated with each characteristic.\nPlease note that the characteristics \\(k_j\\) of the scheme in Table 3.2 do not represent different states of nature but represent characteristics and its corresponding utility (whatever that number may mean in particular) of one particular characteristics if we choose a respective alternative.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Weighting scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(k_1\\)\n\\(k_2\\)\n\\(k_3\\)\n\\(k_4\\)\n\\(k_5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(a_1\\)\n3\n0\n7\n1\n4\n\n\n\\(a_2\\)\n4\n1\n4\n2\n1\n\n\n\\(a_3\\)\n4\n0\n3\n2\n1\n\n\n\\(a_4\\)\n5\n1\n2\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomination\nTo arrive at an overall outcome for each alternative and make an informed decision, the first step is to determine whether any alternatives are dominated by others. An alternative is considered dominated if it is not superior in any characteristic compared to at least one other alternative.\nDominated alternatives can be excluded from consideration. For example, in Table 3.3, we can see that alternative 2 outperforms alternative 3. This makes it unnecessary to consider alternative 3 in the decision-making process.\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Alternative 3 is dominated by alternative 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(k_1\\)\n\\(k_2\\)\n\\(k_3\\)\n\\(k_4\\)\n\\(k_5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(a_1\\)\n3\n0\n7\n1\n4\n\n\n\\(a_2\\)\n4\n1\n4\n2\n1\n\n\n\\(a_3\\)\n4\n0\n3\n2\n1\n\n\n\\(a_4\\)\n5\n1\n2\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighting\n\nNo preferences\nStill, we have three alternative left. How to decide? Well, we need to become clear what characteristics matter (most). Suppose you don’t have any preferences than you would go for restaurant \\(a_1\\) because it offers the best average value, see Table 3.4.\n\n\n\nTable 3.4: Alternative 1 is the best on average\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(k_1\\)\n\\(k_2\\)\n\\(k_3\\)\n\\(k_4\\)\n\\(k_5\\)\nOverall\n\n\n\n\n\\(a_1\\)\n3\n0\n7\n1\n4\n14/5\n\n\n\\(a_2\\)\n4\n1\n4\n2\n1\n12/5\n\n\n\\(a_4\\)\n5\n1\n2\n3\n1\n12/5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear preferences\nSuppose you have a preference for the first three characteristics, that are quality of the food (\\(k_1\\)), the quality of the music played (\\(k_2\\)), and the price (\\(k_3\\)). Specifically, suppose that your preference scheme is as follows:\n\\[\ng_1 : g_2 : g_3 : g_4 : g_5 = 3 : 4 : 3 : 1 : 1\n\\]\nThis means, for example, that you value music (\\(k_2\\)) four times more than the quality of the service (\\(k_4\\)) and the overall environment (\\(k_5\\)). The weights assigned to each characteristic are:\n\\[\nw_1=3/12; w_2=4/12; w_3=3/12; w_4 = w_5 =1/12.\n\\]\nTo determine the best decision, you can calculate the aggregated expected utility for each alternative as follows:\n\\[\n\\Phi(a_i)=\\sum_{c}w_p\\cdot u_{ic} \\rightarrow max,\n\\]\nwhere \\(u_{ic}\\) represents the utility (or value) of alternative \\(i\\) for a given characteristic \\(c\\). The results of this calculation are shown in Table 3.5.\n\n\n\nTable 3.5: Results with preferences given\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(k_1\\)\n\\(k_2\\)\n\\(k_3\\)\n\\(k_4\\)\n\\(k_5\\)\n\\(\\Phi(a_i)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(a_1\\)\n3\n0\n7\n1\n4\n35/12\n\n\n\\(a_2\\)\n4\n1\n4\n2\n1\n31/12\n\n\n\\(a_4\\)\n5\n1\n2\n3\n1\n29/12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, alternative \\(a_1\\) offers the best value given the preference scheme outlined above. In summary, we express the choice as follows: \\[a_1\\succ a_2 \\succ a_4 \\succ a_3,\\] where \\(\\succ\\) represents the preference relation (that is, “is preferred to”). If two alternatives offer the same value and we are indifferent between them, we can use the symbol \\(\\sim\\) to represent this indifference.\n\n\nMaximax (go for cup)\nIf you like to go for cup, that is, you search for a great experience in at least one characteristic, then, you can choose the alternative that gives the maximum possible output in any characteristic.
