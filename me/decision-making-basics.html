<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> What defines a decision?<a href="decision-making-basics.html#what-defines-a-decision" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The statement of <span class="citation">Eilon (<a href="solutions-to-exercises.html#ref-Eilon1969What">1969</a>)</span> still holds true:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An examination of the literature reveals the somewhat perplexing fact that most books on management and decision theory do not contain a specific definition of what is meant by a decision. One can find detailed descriptions of decision trees, discussions of game theory and analyses of various statistical treatments of payoffs matrices under conditions of uncertainty, but the definition of the decision activity itself is often taken for granted and is associated with making a choice between alternative courses of action.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>decision</em> stems from the latin verb <em>decidere</em> which can have different meanings<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> including make explicit, put an end to, bring to conclusion, settle/decide/agree (on), die, end up, fail, fall in ruin, fall/drop/hang/flow down/off/over, sink/drop, cut/notch/carve to delineate, detach, cut off/out/down, fell, flog thoroughly.</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines <strong>decision making</strong> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In psychology, decision-making […] is regarded as the cognitive process resulting in the selection of a belief or a course of action among several alternative possibilities. Decision-making is the process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the values, preferences and beliefs of the decision-maker. Every decision-making process produces a final choice, which may or may not prompt action. […] Decision-making can be regarded as a problem-solving activity yielding a solution deemed to be optimal, or at least satisfactory. It is therefore a process which can be more or less rational or irrational…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Businessdictionary.com defines a <strong>decision</strong> as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A choice made between alternative courses of action in a situation of uncertainty.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s agree on the following working definition that is symbolized in figure <a href="#fig:decisionm">2.6</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A decision is the point at which a choice is made between alternative—and usually competing—options. As such, it may be seen as a stepping-off point—the moment at which a commitment is made to one course of action to the exclusion of others. (Fitzgerald, 2002, p. 8)</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Types of decisions<a href="decision-making-basics.html#types-of-decisions" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Decision making is a process of investing time and effort to make a decision that will lead to (good) results. In the following, we discuss some types of decisions that can help to design an appropriate decision making process.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation">Fitzgerald (<a href="solutions-to-exercises.html#ref-Fitzgerald2002Decision">2002, p. 9f</a>)</span> decisions can be roughly divided into two generic types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>routine decisions</strong>: Decisions that must be made at regular intervals.</li>
<li><strong>non-routine</strong>: Unique, random, non-recurring decision situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another common method of dividing decisions into two categories is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operative decisions</strong>: This type of decision usually involves day-to-day business operations. There is a lot of overlap with the routine category here. Examples of this type of decision include setting production levels, deciding whether to hire or deciding whether to close a particular plant. When it comes to decisions in our daily lives, an example would be where, what, when, and what we eat for lunch.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic decisions</strong>: This type of decision is usually about company policy and direction over a long period of time. Examples of strategic decisions include entering a new market, acquiring a competitor, or withdrawing from an industry. Renting an apartment near the university or commuting to our parents is an example of a strategic decision in our personal lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>People often distinguish between decisions at work and private decisions. Private decisions affect fewer people on average, but usually the people involved are closer to you personally. However, both types of decisions involve the same things such as people (human resources), money (budgeting), buying and selling (marketing), how we do something (operations) or how we want to do it in the future (strategy and planning).</p>
<p>Some decisions are more important than others because the potential impact of a decision varies, i.e., the <strong>scope of a decision</strong>. For example, decisions can affect one person or millions, one pound/dollar or millions, one product/service or an entire market, one day or ten years, etc.</p>
<p>However, it is not entirely clear how to validate the scope. It depends heavily on the perspective of the decision-maker. For a small company, for example, an investment of 10,000 euros may be a big decision, while for a multinational cooperation it is a drop in the bucket. So the scope for decisions is relative, not absolute. It depends entirely on the context in which the decision is made and on the characteristics of the person(s) making it.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Three conditions of decision making<a href="decision-making-basics.html#three-conditions-of-decision-making" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>

<div class="figcaption"> Conditions of decision making<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></div>
</div>
<p>There are three general conditions (see <a href="#fig:3conditions">2.7</a>) that determine the design of the optimal decision making process: certainty, risk and uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>Certainty:</strong>
A condition under which taking a decision involves reasonable degree of certainty about its result, what are the opportunities and what conditions accompany this decision.</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong>
A condition under which taking a decision involves reasonable degree of certainty about its result, what are the opportunities and what conditions accompany this decision.</p>
<p><strong>Uncertainty:</strong>
A condition in which decision maker does not know all the choices, as well as risks associated with each of them and possible consequences.</p>

<p><span id="exr:fisherman" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 2.5  </strong></span>The businessman and the fisherman</p>
<p>A classic tale that exist in different version^[This one stems from <a href="https://thestorytellers.com/the-businessman-and-the-fisherman">thestorytellers.com</a>. A famous version stems from Paulo Coelho^[See <a href="https://paulocoelhoblog.com/2015/09/04/the-fisherman-and-the-businessman/">https://paulocoelhoblog.com</a> and it goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish.</p>
<p>About that time, a businessman came walking down the beach, trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was fishing instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family. “You aren’t going to catch many fish that way”, said the businessman to the fisherman.</p>
<p>“You should be working rather than lying on the beach!” The fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, “And what will my reward be?” “Well, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!” was the businessman’s answer. “And then what will my reward be?” asked the fisherman, still smiling. The businessman replied, “You will make money and you’ll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish!” “And then what will my reward be?”” asked the fisherman again.</p>
<p>The businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman’s questions. “You can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!” he said. “And then what will my reward be?” repeated the fisherman. The businessman was getting angry. “Don’t you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!”</p>
<p>Once again the fisherman asked, “And then what will my reward be?” The businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, “Don’t you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won’t have a care in the world!”</p>
<p>The fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, “And what do you think I’m doing right now?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Define the cost and benefits of both persons. Who do you think has a better life overall.
Who is acting rationally here? In other words, who is maximizing utility here? The fishermen or the businessmen? Both? None?</p>

<div id="the-rational-model" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> The rational model<a href="decision-making-basics.html#the-rational-model" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Economists view the choices that people make as <em>rational</em>. A rational choice is one that compares costs and benefits and achieves the greatest benefit over cost for the person making the choice. Whatever the benefits and the costs maybe, a decision maker have to consider all and make a decision. Of course, in reality it is often difficult if not impossinle to sum up benefits and costs as the nature of both may be totally different. To get rid of these problems economists use a theoretical concept that measures both in <em>utility</em>. That is a general and abstract measure to model worth or value. Its usage has evolved significantly over time. The term was introduced initially as a measure of pleasure or happiness within the theory of utilitarianism. It represents the satisfaction or pleasure that people receive for consuming a bundle of goods and services, for example.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation">CEOpedia (<a href="solutions-to-exercises.html#ref-CEOpedia2021Rational">2021</a>)</span> rational decision making is a style of decision making based on objective data and a formal process of analysis. It excludes acting based on subjective feelings and intuitive approach. The model assumes that deducting decisions with full information and all alternatives allows for the creation of cognitive skills that allow the evaluation of all possible options and then the selection of the best one.</p>
<p>It essentially consists of a logical sequence of steps. Here is an example taken from <span class="citation">Fitzgerald (<a href="solutions-to-exercises.html#ref-Fitzgerald2002Decision">2002, p. 13</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Clearly identify the problem</strong>. A <em>problem</em> can be defined as a perceived gap between the current reality and the desired reality.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generate potential solutions</strong>. For routine decisions, various alternatives can be identified relatively easily using predetermined decision rules, but non-routine decisions require a creative process to find new alternatives.</p></li>
<li><p>Using appropriate analytical approaches, select a solution from the available alternatives, preferably the one with the largest expected value. In decision theory, this is called <strong>maximizing the expected utility of the outcomes</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implement the solution</strong>. Managers often undermine implementation by not ensuring that those responsible for implementation understand and accept what they need to do, and that they have the motivation and resources needed for successful implementation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented decision</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>While these rational models may be helpful, they can also be criticized in a number of ways. In particular, it is a belief that managers actually optimize their decision behavior based on rationality because they consciously select and implement the best alternatives. This is a misconception because any rational optimization is based on a number of dubious assumptions. For example, (Fitzgerald, 2002, p. 13):</p>
<ul>
<li>it is hardly possible to know in advance all possible alternative solutions and to know in advance the specific outcomes that will result from each of them;</li>
<li>there is actually an optimal solution, and this solution is among the alternatives identified;</li>
<li>it is possible to accurately and numerically weight the various alternatives, the probabilities of their outcomes, and the relative desirability of these alternatives and outcomes;</li>
<li>the decision makers always act rationally and therefore the decision making is free of emotion, bias, and politics; and</li>
<li>business decisions are driven entirely by the desire to maximize profits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>rational model can be considered normative</strong> because it prescribes a strict logical sequence of steps to be followed in any decision-making situation. The rational models are based on the assumption that human behavior is logical and therefore predictable under certain circumstances. This is not necessarily what actually happens in the real world. Consider, for example, the findings in the field of behavioral economics, which clearly show that homo economicus is a (useful) concept that is weak in several aspects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“combined different scientific disciplines and considered new factors in economic theories. Established economic theories held that enterprises and entrepreneurs all acted in completely rational ways, with the maximization of their own profit as their only goal. In contrast, Simon held that when making choices all people deviate from the strictly rational, and described companies as adaptable systems, with physical, personal, and social components. Through these perspectives, he was able to write about decision-making processes in modern society in an entirely new way”.</p>

<p>Bounded rationality proposes that decision making is constrained by managers’ ability to process information, i.e., the rationally is <em>bounded</em> (see figure <a href="#fig:boundedrationality">2.10</a>). Managers use shortcuts and rules of thumb which are based on their prior experience with similar problems and scenarios. Given the constraints of managers in their position, they do not actually <em>optimize</em> their choice given the available information. It is more like finding a <em>satisfactory</em> solution, not necessarily the <em>best</em> or the <em>optimal</em> solution.</p>

<p><span id="exr:irrational" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 2.7  </strong></span>Are we irrational?</p>
<p>Discuss the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the rationality of individuals is bounded and it is obvious that individuals do not make optimal decisions, we can say that individuals act irrationally.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Homo economicus<a href="decision-making-basics.html#homo-economicus" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The so-called <em>homo economicus</em> is often modeled by the assumption of perfect rationality. Actors are assumed to always act in a way that maximizes their utility (as consumers) and profit (as producers), and to this end they are capable of arbitrarily complex reasoning. That is, it is assumed that they are always capable of thinking through all possible outcomes and choosing the course of action that leads to the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>Of course, the assumption of <em>homo economicus</em> is heroic, and I doubt that any serious economist has ever assumed that this assumption can be found one-to-one in reality. However, it is an assumption that helps to make predictions and explain the behavior of people and societies to some extent. I mean, what would happen if microeconomics went to the other extreme assuming irrationally acting individuals. The result would be, more or less, that we would not be able to make predictions and the future would be a random walk.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, economists and anyone who wants to make, apply, or think about economic theories should be aware of all the pitfalls that arise in our decision making and know that our ability to act rationally is limited. In real life, we often use heuristics to solve problems and make decisions.</p>
<p>A <strong>heuristic</strong> is any approach to solving a problem that uses a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational. However, a heuristic should–at best–be sufficient to achieve an immediate, short-term goal or approximation. Overall, people use heuristics because they either cannot act completely rationally or want to act rationally but do not have the time it would take to compute the perfect solution. Moreover, the effort is probably not worth it or simply not possible given the time constraints under which the problem must be solved.
A heuristic is a mental shortcut or rule of thumb to make decisions and solve problems quickly and efficiently. It helps individuals to arrive at a solution without extensive analysis or evaluation of all available information. Heuristics are usefull when time, resources, or information are limited.</p>
<p>While heuristics can be helpful in many situations, they can also lead to errors and biases, particularly when they are overused or misapplied. We will discuss some of these biases in section <a href="decision-making-basics.html#cognitive-biases">2.11</a> in greater detail.</p>

<pre><code>
If we assume that all objectives are independent from each other and that we are certain about the state of nature, the decision is rather trivial: just go for the alternative with the best outcome for each state of nature. However, most real-world scenarios are not that simple because most states of nature are more complex and needs further to be considered. 

## Review

-  Decision analysis is about using information in order to come to a decision.
-  A structured and rational process can help improve the chances of receiving good decision outcomes. 
-  As decision problems are often (too) complex to fully capture or solve rationally. Thus, a good decision analysis should try to use the available information and the existing understanding of the problem as transparent, consistent, and logical as possible. 
-  A complex decision problem should be simplified and hence decomposed into its basic and most important components.
-  There are hundred of different _schemes_ or _strategies_ how to make decisions in certain circumstances. Many heuristics exist how to think, behave, and calculate to come to a wise decision. 
-  Mostly decisions are based on subjective expectations. These expectations are difficult to validate. 
-  Articulating exact expectation and preferences is a difficult task and the information that stems from these articulation is full of biases. Decision analytic tools need to take that into consideration.

Lisa is pregnant

The following question stems from a study carried out by @Kahneman1972Subjective: Lisa is thirty-three and is pregnant for the first time. She is worried about birth defects such as Down syndrome. Her doctor tells her that she need not worry too much because there is only a 1 in 1,000 chance that a woman of her age will have a baby with Down syndrome. Nevertheless, Lisa remains anxious about this possibility and decides to obtain a test, known as the Triple Screen, that can detect Down syndrome. The test is moderately accurate: When a baby has Down syndrome, the test delivers a positive result 86 percent of the time. There is, however, a small &#39;false positive&#39; rate: 5 percent of babies produce a positive result despite not       having Down syndrome. Lisa takes the Triple Screen and obtains a positive result for Down syndrome.  

Given this test result, what are the chances that her baby has Down syndrome?

a) 0-20 percent chance
b) 21-40 percent chance
c) 41-60 percent chance
d) 61-80 percent chance
e) 81-100 percent chance

# Decision making theory

## Decision making under certainty

---

After successful completion of the module, students are able to:

- Distinguish different theories of decision making. 
- Calculate the optimal decision under certainty, uncertainty, and under risk. 
- Describe and use various criteria of decision making.
- Simplify complex decision making situations and use formal approaches of decision making to guide the decision making behavior of managers. 
- Avoid common mistakes when applying heuristics in decision making.
- Use investment calculus to make good financial decisions. 

---




Decision making under certainty means that we assume that we are certain about the future state of nature, i.e., we have complete information about the alternative actions and their consequences. Making decisions under certainty may seem like a trivial exercise. However, many problems are so complex that sophisticated mathematical techniques are sometimes needed to find the best solution.




### Decision making with complex state of natures


Suppose you have to decide between four different restaurants where you want to go out to eat ($a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$). The restaurants have different characteristics such as the quality of the food k1, the quality of the music played $k_2$, the price $k_3$, the quality of the service $k_4$, and the environment $k_5$. The corresponding payoff table is given below. High numbers represent good quality. In other words, $a_i$ refer to competing alternatives where to eat for dinner, and $k_i$ are certain characteristics of the respective restaurant, and the numbers given in the table indicate the output.

|  | $k_1$ | $k_2$ | $k_3$ | $k_4$ | $k_5$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $a_1$ | 3 | 0 | 7 | 1 | 4 |
| $a_2$ | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| $a_3$ | 4 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| $a_4$ | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 |

: Weighting scheme

### Domination {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Some alternative can be excluded because they are **dominated** by other alternatives. In the scheme above you can see that alternative 2 is always superior to alternative 3, i.e., alternative 3 is dominated by alternative 2. Thus, it does not make sense to think about alternative 3:

|  | $k_1$ | $k_2$ | $k_3$ | $k_4$ | $k_5$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $a_1$ | 3 | 0 | 7 | 1 | 4 |
| $a_2$ | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| $a_3$ | ~~4~~ | ~~0~~ | ~~3~~ | ~~2~~ | ~~1~~ |
| $a_4$ | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 |

: Alternative 3 is dominated by alternative 2


### Weighting  {.unlisted .unnumbered}

As the objectives $k_j$ of the scheme above do not represent different states of nature but represent characteristics and its corresponding utility (whatever that number may mean in particular) of one particular characteristics if we choose a respective alternative. For example, think of that you can choose one out of four restaurants, $a_1,\dots,a_4$, in order to eat a five-course menu, $k_1,\dots,k_5$, and the outcome represents your utility of each course, $j$, for each restaurant, $i$. We already know from the domination principle that restaurant $a_3$ is a bad choice.

Suppose you have a preference for the first three courses. Specifically, suppose that your preference scheme is as follows:

$$
g_1 : g_2 : g_3 : g_4 : g_5 = 3 : 4 : 3 : 1 : 1
$$

This means, for example, that you value the second food course four times more than the last course.

$$
w_1=3/12; w_2=4/12; w_3=3/12; w_4 = w_5 =1/12.
$$

In order to find a decision criteria you can calculate the aggregated expected utility as follows:

$$
\Phi(a_i)=\sum_{p=1}^{r}w_p\cdot u_{ip} \rightarrow max
$$

The results are as follows:


|  | $k_1$ | $k_2$ | $k_3$ | $k_4$ | $k_5$ | $\Phi(a_i)$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $a_1$ | 3 | 0 | 7 | 1 | 4 | 35//12 |
| $a_2$ | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 31//12 |
| $a_3$ | 4 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 24//12 |
| $a_4$ | 5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 29//12 |

Thus, $a_1\succ a_2 \succ a_4 \succ a_3$, i.e., you prefer alternative $a_1$.


### Preferences and decision criteria {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Maybe not all courses play the same role for you so you can take your decision based on your preference scheme. For example, assume some courses are more important to you than others such as $k_1 \succ k_3 \succ k_2 \succ k_4 \succ k_5$. Now, if you decide based on your most important course you should choose restaurant 4 because this gives you the highest utility in that dish. If you further assume that you are not that hungry and you only like to have two dishes, then you should probably better go for restaurant 1 because the aggregated utility in the two preferred courses is 10 utility units and restaurants 2, 3 and 4 can only offer 8, 7 and 7 utility units in your two preferred courses.

### Körth&#39;s Maximin-Rule {.unlisted .unnumbered}

According to this rule, we compare alternatives by the worst possible outcome under each alternative, and we should choose the one which maximizes the utility of the worst outcome. More concrete, the procedure consists of 4 steps:

1. Calculate the utility maximum for each column of the payoff matrix:  $$\overline{O}j=\max{i=1,\dots,m}{O_{ij}}\qquad \forall j.$$
2. Calculate for each cell the relative utility, $$\frac{O_{ij}}{\overline{O}_j}.$$
3. Calculate for each row the minimum: $$\Phi(a_i)=\min_{j=1,\dots,p}\left(\frac{O_{ij}}{\overline{O}_j}\right).$$
4. Set preferences by maximizing $\Phi(a_i)$.





### Linear programming

Linear Programming is a common technique for decision making under certainty. It allows to express a desired benefit (such as profit) as a mathematical function of several variables. The solution is the set of values for the independent variables (decision variables) that serves to maximize the benefit or to minimize the negative outcome under consideration of certain limits, a.k.a. constraints. The method usually follows a four step procedure: 

1. state the problem; 
2. state the decision variables; 
3. set up an objective function; 
4. clarify the constraints.

Consider a factory producing two products, product X and product Y. The problem is this: If
you can realize \$10.00 profit per unit of product X and \$14.00 per unit of product Y, what is the production level of x units of product X and y units of product Y that maximizes the profit P each day? Your production, and therefore your profit, is subject to resource limitations, or constraints. Assume in this example that you employ five workers---three machinists and two assemblers---and that each works only 40 hours a week.^[The example is taken from @Morse2014Managing[p. 134f].]

- Product X requires three hours of machining and one hour of assembly per unit.
- Product Y requires two hours of machining and two hours of assembly per unit.

1. _State the problem:_  How many of product X and product Y to produce to maximize profit?
2. _Decision variables:_ Suppose x denotes the number of product X to produce per day and y denotes number of product Y to produce per day
3. _Objective function:_ Maximize $$P = 10x + 14y$$
4. _Constraints:_
- machine time=120h
- assembling time=80h
- hours needed for production of one good:

_machine time:_ $x\rightarrow 3h$ and   $y \rightarrow 2h$  

_assembling time:_ $x\rightarrow 1h$ and $y \rightarrow 2h$ 

    
Thus, we get:
$$3x + 2y \leq 120 \quad \Leftrightarrow y\leq 60-\frac{3}{2}x \quad \text{(hours of machining time)}$$
$$x + 2y \leq 80 \quad \Leftrightarrow y \leq 40-\frac{1}{2}x \quad \text{(hours of assembly time)}$$
Since there are only two products, these limitations can be shown on a two-dimensional graph (\@ref(fig:lpe2)). Since all relationships are linear, the solution to our problem will fall at one of the corners. 


![(\#fig:lpe2) Linear program example: constraints and solution](fig/lpe2.jpg){ width=75% }

To draw the isoprofit function in a plot with the good $y$ on the y-axis and good $x$ on the x-axis, we can re-arrange the objective function to get $$y=\frac{1}{14}P-\frac{10}{14}x$$
To illustrate the function let us consider some arbitrarily chosen levels of profit in \autoref{fig:lpe}:

- \$350 by selling 35 units of X or 25 units of Y
- \$700 by selling 70 units of X or 50 units of Y
- \$620 by selling 62 units of X or 44.3 units of Y.

![(\#fig:lpe) Linear program example: isoprofit lines](fig/lpe.jpg){ width=75% }

    
To find the solution, begin at some feasible solution (satisfying the given constraints) such as $(x,y) = (0,0)$, and proceed in the direction of _steepest ascent_ of the profit function (in this case, by increasing production of Y at \$14.00 profit per unit) until some constraint is reached. Since assembly hours are limited to 80, no more than 80/2, or 40, units of Y can be made, earning $40 \cdot \$14.00$, or \$560 profit. Then proceed along the steepest allowable ascent from there (along the assembly constraint line) until another constraint (machining hours) is reached. At that point, (x,y) = (20,30) and profit P = (20 * +10.00) + (30 * +14.00), or \$620. Since there is no remaining edge along which profit increases, this is the optimum solution.

### Lagrange multiplier method

![(\#fig:Lagrange) Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813)^[Picture is taken from http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/PictDisplay/Lagrange.html]](fig/Lagrange.jpg){ width=50% }  

The decision-making process of consumers and producers lies at the core of microeconomic research and is of significant importance for managers. I will not go into detail here, but I will show some examples of how to come to a decision when certain information is given.

Before we come to the Lagrangian multplier method, let me define what (micro)economist mean when they speak of firms and consumers.  

A _firm_ is a productive unit. In particular, it is an organization that produces goods and services, called the *output*. To do so, it uses inputs called *factors of production*: labor, capital, land, skills, etc. The relationship between the inputs and the output is the production function. The goal of the firm is to achieve whatever goal its owner(s) decide to achieve. Usually, it is (and in Germany, for example, it has to be the case by law) to generate profits, i.e., total revenue minus total cost for the level of production.
Determining the optimal level of production for a firm is a multifaceted decision that encompasses various strategic aspects and is heavily influenced by the market situation of firms. This includes factors such as market power, demand function, production function, cost function, and revenue function. 

A consumer is an individual that purchases goods or services to satisfy their needs. They make decisions regarding what to buy, how much to buy in order to maximize their utility. Microeconomists study consumer behavior and factors that influence it, such as prices, income, preferences, and market conditions, to understand the choices consumers make and their impact on markets and the overall economy.

For a deeper understanding of the microeconomic preliminaries related to this topic, please read section \@ref(micro-pre) of the appendix. 



![(\#fig:lagr2) Contours of the function and the constraint in red](fig/lagr2.png){ width=70% }  

The Lagrange multiplier method, named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, 
is a strategy for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to constraints. 
The red curve in Figure \@ref(fig:lagr2) represents the constraint $g(x, y) = c$, 
while the blue curves depict contours of $f(x, y)$. 
The point where the red constraint tangentially intersects a blue contour 
represents the maximum of $f(x, y)$ along the constraint, as $d1 &gt; d2$.

For a detailed visual explanation of the method, you can watch Dr. Trefor Bazett&#39;s 
YouTube video on [Lagrange Multipliers | Geometric Meaning &amp; Full Example](https://youtu.be/8mjcnxGMwFo), see figure \@ref(fig:lagrange-yt).


![(\#fig:lagrange-yt) Lagrange Multiplier graphically explained^[This is a snapshot of a YouTube clip, see: https://youtu.be/8mjcnxGMwFo]](fig/lagrange-yt.png){ width=40% }  

The Lagrange multiplier method, named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange,
is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems with constraints. 
It allows us to find the local maxima and minima of a function subject to certain conditions. 
The method involves four key steps:

**Step 1: Formulate the Problem**

Define the problem you want to solve in mathematical terms. 
This includes specifying the objective function to be maximized or minimized and the constraints that need to be satisfied.

The problem that we want to solve can be written in the following way,
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
    \max _{x, y} &amp; F(x, y) \\
    \
    text { s.t. } &amp; g(x, y)=0
\end{array}
$$
where $F(x, y)$ is the function to be maximized and $g(x, y)=0$ is the constraint to be respected. 
Notice that $\max _{x, y}$ means that we must solve (maximize) with respect to $x$ and $y$.

**Step 2: Construct the Lagrangian**

Create a new function called the Lagrangian by combining the objective function 
and the constraints using Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian introduces new variables, 
known as Lagrange multipliers, to account for the constraints.
The Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}$, is a combination of the functions that explain the problem: 
The $\lambda$ is called the _Lagrange Multiplier_.
$$
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda)=F(x, y)-\lambda g(x, y)
$$

**Step 3: Determine the First-Order Conditions**

Differentiate the Lagrangian with respect to the variables of the problem (e.g., x and y) 
and the Lagrange multipliers. Set the partial derivatives equal to zero to obtain 
the first-order conditions. These conditions represent the necessary conditions for optimality.

Differentiate $\mathcal{L}$ w.r.t. $x, y,$ and $\lambda$ and equate the partial derivatives to 0:
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda)}{\partial x}=0 &amp; \Leftrightarrow \frac{\partial F(x, y)}{\partial x}-\lambda \frac{\partial g(x, y)}{\partial x}=0 \\
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda)}{\partial y}=0 &amp; \Leftrightarrow \frac{\partial F(x, y)}{\partial y}-\lambda \frac{\partial g(x, y)}{\partial y}=0 \\
    \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda)}{\partial \lambda}=0 &amp; \Leftrightarrow g(x, y)=0
\end{align*}

**Step 4: Solve the System of Equations**

Solve the system of equations obtained from the first-order conditions to find the values of the variables and Lagrange multipliers that satisfy the optimality conditions. The solutions represent the optimal quantities that maximize or minimize the objective function subject to the given constraints.

By following these four steps, you can effectively apply the Lagrange multiplier method to various optimization problems with constraints. It provides a systematic approach to finding the optimal solutions while incorporating the necessary trade-offs imposed by the constraints.

## Decision making under uncertainty

When it comes to decision-making under uncertainty you need to have a criterion that helps you to come to a *rational* decision. The choice of criteria is a matter of taste and should at best fit with overall (business) strategy. 

### Laplace criterion {.unlisted .unnumbered}

In case of different possible states of nature and no information on their probability of occurrences, the Laplace criterion simply assigns equal probabilities to the possible pay offs for each action and then selecting that alternative which corresponds to the maximum *expected* pay off. An example is given in @Finne1998three.

### Maximax criterion (go for cup)  {.unlisted .unnumbered}

If you like to *go for cup*, i.e., like to have the best out of the best possible outcome without taking into consideration the fact that this may potentially also result in the worst possible scenario, then, you can choose the alternative that gives the maximum possible output. 

### Minimax criterion (best of the worst) {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The Minimax (or maximin) criterion is a conservative criterion because it is based on making the best out of the worst possible conditions. Again, examples on how to calculate it are given in @Finne1998three..

### Savage Minimax criterion {.unlisted .unnumbered}

This criterion aims to minimize the worst-case regret to perform as closely as possible to the optimal course. Since the minimax criterion applied here is to the regret (difference or ratio of the payoffs) rather than to the payoff itself, it is not as pessimistic as the ordinary minimax approach. For more details, please read @Finne1998three.

### Hurwicz criterion {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The Hurwicz criterion allows the decision maker to calculates a weighted average between the best and worst possible payoff for each decision alternative. Then, the alternative with the maximum weighted average is chosen.

For each decision alternative, the weight $\alpha$ is used to compute Hurwicz the value:
\[H_i=\alpha \cdot \overline{O}_i + (1-\alpha)\cdot \underline{O}_i\]
where $\overline{O}_i=\max_{j=1,\dots,p}{O_{ij}}\qquad \forall i$ and  $\underline{O}_i=\min_{j=1,\dots,p}{O_{ij}}\qquad \forall i$, i.e., the respective maximum and minimum Output for each alternative, $i$.
The example that is shown in Figure 7 of @Finne1998three[p.401] contains some errors. Here is the _correct table_ including the Hurwicz-values (we assume a $\alpha=.5$):

  
$O_{ij}$    $min(\theta_1)$   $max(\theta_2)$   $H_i$
---------- ----------------- ----------------- -------
$a_1$             36                110          73
$a_2$             40                100          70
$a_3$             58                74           66
$a_4$             61                66          63.5

Thus, the order of preference is $a_4\succ a_3 \succ a_1 \succ a_2$.

## Decision making under risk

When some information is given about the probability of occurrence of states of nature, we speak of _decision-making under risk_. The most straight forward technique to make a decision here is to maximize the expected outcome for each alternative given the probability of occurrence, $p_j$. 
    
However, the expected utility hypothesis states that the subjective value associated with an individual&#39;s gamble is the statistical expectation of that individual&#39;s valuations of the outcomes of that gamble, where these valuations may differ from the Euro value of those outcomes. Thus, you should better look on the utility of a respective outcome rather than on the outcome itself because the utility and outcome do not have to be linked in a linear way. The St. Petersburg Paradox by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738  is considered the beginnings of the hypothesis.

### St. Petersburg Paradox  

#### Ininite St. Petersburg lotteries

Suppose a casino offers a game of chance for a single player, where a fair coin is tossed at each stage. At the beginning, the player stakes \$1. Every time a head appears, the stake is doubled. The game continues until the first tails appears, at which point the player receives $\$ 2^{k-1}$, where k is the number of tosses (number of heads) plus one (for the final tails).
For instance, if tails appears on the first toss, the player wins \$0. If tails appears on the second toss, the player wins \$2. If tails appears on the third toss, the player wins \$4, and so on. The extensive form is given in figure \@ref(fig:spextensiveform).

![(\#fig:spextensiveform) Extensive form of the St. Petersburg paradox](fig/spextensiveform.png){ width=80% }

Given the rules of the game, what would be a fair price for the player to pay the casino in order to enter the game?
        
To answer this question, one needs to consider the expected payout: The player has a 1/2 probability of winning $1, a 1/4 probability of winning $2, a 1/8 probability of winning $4, and so on. Thus, the overall expected value can be calculated as follows:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{8} \cdot 4+ \frac{1}{16} \cdot 8 + \dots 
\]
This can be simplified as:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \dots = + \infty.
\]
That means the expected win for playing this game is an infinite amount of money. Based on the expected value, a risk-neutral individual should be willing to play the game at any price if given the opportunity. 
The willingness to pay of most people who have given the opportunity to play the game deviates dramatically from the objectively calculable expected payout of the lottery. This describes the apparent paradox.

In the context of the St. Petersburg Paradox, it becomes evident that relying solely on expected values is inadequate for certain games and for making well-informed decisions. Expected utility, on the other hand, has been the prevailing concept used to reconcile actual behavior with the notion of rationality thus far.


#### Finite St. Petersburg lotteries 

Let us assume that at the beginning, the casino and the player agrees upon how many times the coin will be tossed. So we have a finite number I of lotteries with $1 \leq I \leq \infty$. 

To calculate the expected value of the game, the probability $p(i)$ of throwing any number $i$ of consecutive head is crucial. This probability is given by
$$
p(i)=\underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \cdots \frac{1}{2}}_{i \text { Faktoren }}=\frac{1}{2^{i}}
$$
The payoff $W(I)$ is, if head appears $I$-times in a row by
$$
W(I)=2^{I-1}
$$
The expected payoff $E(W(I))$ if the coin is flipped $I$ times is then given by 
$$
E(W(I))=\sum_{i=1}^{I} p(i) \cdot W(i)=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{2^{i}} \cdot 2^{i-1}=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{2}=\frac{I}{2}
$$

Thus, the expected payoff grows proportionally with the maximum number of rolls. This is because at any point in the game, the option to keep playing has a positive value no matter how many times head has appeared before.
Thus, the expected value of the game is infinitely high for an unlimited number of tosses but not so for a limited number of tosses. Even with a very limited maximum number of tosses of, for example, $I = 100$, only a few players would be willing to pay
\$50 for participation. The relatively high probability to leave the game with no or very low winnings leads in general to a subjective rather low evaluation that is below the expected value.

In the real world, we understand that money is limited and the casino offering this game also operates within a limited budget. 
Let&#39;s assume, for example, that the casino&#39;s maximum budget is \$20,000,000. As a result, the game must conclude after 25 coin tosses because $2^{25} = 33,554,432$ would exceed the casino&#39;s financial capacity. Consequently, the expected value of the game in this scenario would be significantly reduced to just $12.50. 
Interestingly, if you were to ask people, most would still be willing to pay less than $12.50 to participate. How can we explain this? Well, it is not the expected outcome that matters but the utility that stems from the outcome.


#### The impact of output on utility matters

_Daniel Bernoulli_ (1700 - 1782) worked on the paradox while being a professor in St. Petersburg. His solution builds on the conceptual separation of the expected payoff and its utility. He describes the basis of the paradox as follows: 

&gt; ``Until now scientists have usually rested their hypothesis on the assumption that all gains must be evaluated exclusively in terms of themselves, i.e.,  on the basis of their intrinsic qualities, and that these gains will always produce a utility directly proportionate to the gain.&#39;&#39; [@Bernoulli1954Exposition, p. 27]


The relationship between gain and utility, however, is not simply directly proportional but rather more complex. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the game based on expected utility rather than just the expected payoff.
$$
E(u(W(I)))=\sum_{i=1}^{I} p(i) \cdot u(W(i))=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{2^{i}} \cdot u\left(2^{i-1}\right)
$$
Daniel Bernoulli himself proposed the following logarithmic utility function:
$$
u(W)=a \cdot \ln (W),
$$
where $a$ is a positive constant. Using this function in the expected utility, we get
$$
E(u(W(I)))=\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{1}{2^{i}} \cdot a \cdot \ln \left(2^{i-1}\right)=a \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{i-1}{2^{i}} \ln 2=a \cdot \ln 2 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{i-1}{2^{i}}.
$$
The infinite series, $\sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{i-1}{2^{i}}$, converges to 1 ($\lim _{I \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{I} \frac{i-1}{2^{i}}=1$). Thus, given an ex ante unbounded number of throws, the expected utility of the game is given by
$$
E(u(W(\infty)))=a \cdot \ln 2 .
$$

In experiments in which people were offered this game, their willingness to pay was roughly between 2 and 3 Euro. Thus, the suggests logarithmic utility function seems to be a pretty realistic specification.
The main reason is mathematically that the increasing expected payoff has decreasing marginal utility and hence the utility function reflects the risk aversion of many people.

The next chapter will deal with stochastics. In Germany, stochastics is taught in the Gymnasium. If you are not from Germany, it was probably also part of your school experience. When I moved to Cologne in 2020, I found the following page shown in figure \@ref(fig:inschool) that I had received from my high school math teacher. It was September 1993 and I was a desperate fifth grader in my fourth week. Perhaps you&#39;d like to share your experiences with stochastics?

### Terminology: $P(A)$, $P(A|B)$, $\Omega$, $\cap$, $\neg$, ... 


#### Sample space

A result of an _experiment_ is called an _outcome_. An experiment is a planned operation carried out under controlled conditions. Flipping a fair coin twice is an example of an experiment.
The _sample space_ of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes.
The Greek letter $\Omega$ is often used to denote the sample space. For example, if you flip a fair coin, $\Omega = \{H, T\}$ where the outcomes heads and tails are denoted with $H$ and $T$, respectively.

__Example: Sample space__
Find the sample space for the following experiments:

a) One coin is tossed.
b) Two coins are tossed once.
c) Two dices are tossed once.
d) Picking two marbles, one at a time, from a bag that contains many blue, $B$, and red marbles, $R$. 
    
__Solutions:__ 

a) $\Omega = \{head, tail\}$
b) $\Omega = \{(head, head), (tail, tail),(head, tail),(tail, head)\}$
c) Overall, 36 different outcomes: 
        $\{ 
        (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,1),(2,2),\dots,(6,6)
        \}$
d) $\Omega = \{(B,B), (B,R), (R,B), (R,R)\}$.

Overall, there are three ways to represent a sample space:

1. to list the possible outcomes (see example above), 
2. to create a tree diagram (see \@ref(fig:decisiontree)), or 
3. to create a Venn diagram (see \@ref(fig:venndiagramm)).

#### Probability
Probability is a measure that is associated with how certain we are of outcomes of a particular experiment or activity. The probability of an event $A$, written $P(A)$, is defined as 
\[
P(A)=\frac{\
text{Number of outcomes favorable to the occurrence of } A}{\text{Total number of equally likely outcomes}}=\frac{n(A)}{n(\Omega)}
\]
For example, A dice has 6 sides with 6 different numbers on it. In particular, the set of _elements_ of a dice is $M=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Thus, the probability to receive a 6 is 1/6 because we look for one wanted outcome in six possible outcomes.

__Example: Probability__

When a fair dice is thrown, what is the probability of getting

a) the number 5,
b) a number that is a multiple of 3,
c) a number that is greater than 6,
d) a positive number that is less than 7. 

__Solutions:__  A fair dice is an unbiased dice where each of the six numbers is equally likely to turn up. The sample space is $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.
    
a) Let A be the event of getting the number 5, $A=\{5\}$. Then, $P(A)=\frac{1}{6}$.
b) Let $B$ be the event of getting a multiple of 3, $B=\{3, 6\}$. Then, $P(B)=\frac{1}{3}$.
c) Let $C$ be the event of getting a number greater than 6, $C=7,8,\dots$. Then, $P(C)=0$ as there is no number greater than 6 in the sample space $\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.    A probability of 0 means the event will never occur.
d) Let D be the event of getting a number less than 7, $D=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Then, $P=1$ as the event will always occur.

#### The complement of an event ($\neg-Event$)

The complement of event $A$ is denoted with a $\neg A$ or sometimes with a superscript `c&#39; like $A^c$. 
It consists of all outcomes that are _not_ in $A$. Thus, it should be clear that $P(A) + P(\neg A) =! 1$. 
For example, let the sample space be $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ and let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. 
Then, $\neg A = \{5, 6\}$; $P(A) = \frac{4}{6}$; $P(\neg A) = \frac{2}{6}$; and $P(A) + P(\neg A) = \frac{4}{6}+\frac{2}{6} = 1$.

#### Independent events (AND-events) 
Two events are independent when the outcome of the first event does not influence the outcome of the second event.
For example, if you throw a dice and a coin, the number on the dice does not affect whether the result you get on the coin. 
More formally, two events are independent if the following are true:
\begin{align*}
    P(A|B) &amp;= P(A)\\
    P(B|A) &amp;= P(B)\\
    P(A \cap B) &amp;= P(A)P(B)
\end{align*}

To calculate the probability of two independent events ($X$ and $Y$) happen, the probability of the first event, $P(X)$, has to be multiplied with the probability of the second event, $P(Y)$:
\[ P(X \text{ and } Y)=P(X \cap Y)=P(X)\cdot P(Y),\]
where $\cap$ stands for `and&#39;. 
For example, let $A$ and $B$ be $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$, respectively. Then $A \cap B = \{4, 5\}$.

__Example: Three dices__

Suppose you have three dice. Calculate the probability of getting three 4$.}

__Solutions:__
The probability of getting a $4$ on one dice is 1/6. The probability of getting three $4$ is:
\[
P(4 \cap 4 \cap 4) = \frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{6}= \frac{1}{216}
\]


#### Dependent events ($|$-Events)
Events are dependent when one event affects the outcome of the other. If $A$ and $B$ are dependent events then the probability of both occurring is the product of the probability of $A$ and the probability of $A$ _after_ $B$ has occurred:
\begin{align*}
    P(A \cap B)&amp;=P(A)\cdot P(B|A),\\
    \Leftrightarrow P(B|A)&amp;=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}\cdot 
\end{align*}
where `$|A$&#39; stands for `after A has occurred&#39;, or `given A has occurred&#39;. In other words, $P(B|A)$ is the probability of $B$ given $A$. This equation is also known as the  __Multiplication Rule__.

The conditional probability of A given B is written $P(A|B)$. $P(A|B)$ is the probability that event A will occur given that the event B has already occurred. A conditional reduces the sample space. We calculate the probability of A from the reduced sample space B. The formula to calculate $P(A|B)$ is \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P\left(A\cap B\right)}{P\left(B\right)}\] where $P(B)$ is greater than zero.
This formula is also known as __Bayes&#39; Theorem__, which is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities, states that 
\[
P(A)P(B|A)=P(B)P(A|B)
\]
This is true since $P(A \cap B)=P(B \cap A)$ and due to the fact that $P(A\cap B)=P(B\mid A)P(A)$, we can write Bayes&#39; Theorem as
\[P(A\mid B)={\frac {P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}}.\]
The box below summarizes the important facts w.r.t. Bayes&#39; Theorem.


For example, suppose we toss a fair, six-sided die. The sample space $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. Let $A$ be face is 2 or 3 and let $B$ be face is even (2, 4, 6). To calculate $P(A|B)$, we count the number of outcomes 2 or 3 in the sample space $B = \{2, 4, 6\}$. Then we divide that by the number of outcomes $B$ (rather than $\Omega$).

We get the same result by using the formula. Remember that $\Omega$ has six outcomes.
\[P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(B\cap A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{\text{number of outcomes that are 2 or 3 and even}}{6}}{\frac{\text{number of outcomes that are even}}{6}}=\frac{\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{3}{6}}=\frac{1}{3} \]


### Bayes&#39; Theorem

The theorem states that 
\[P(A\mid B)={\frac {P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}} \]
if $P(B)\neq 0$ and $A$ and $B$ are events. It simply uses the following logical facts:
\[P(B\cap A)=P(A\cap B),\]
\[P(A\mid B)=\frac {P(A\cap B)}{P(B)},  \text{ and}\] 
\[P(B\mid A)=\frac {P(A\cap B)}{P(A)},\]
or, to put it in one line:
\[  P(A\cap B)= P(B\cap A)=P(A\mid B)P(B)=P(B\mid A)P(A).   \]
Sometimes, it is helpful to re-write the Theorem as follows:
\[P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|\neg B)P(\neg B),  \text{ and}\]
\[P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A),\]

__Example: Purse__

A purse contains four € 5 bills, five € 10 bills and three € 20 bills. Two bills are selected randomly without the first selection being replaced. Find the probability that two € 5 bills are selected.  


__Solutions:__ There are four € 5 bills. There are a total of twelve bills.
    The probability to select at first a € 5 bill then is $P(\text{€} 5) = \frac{4}{12}$.
    As the the result of the first draw affects the probability of the second draw, we have to consider that there are only three € 5 bills left and there are a total of eleven bills left. Thus, 
\[
P(\text{€} 5 | \text{€} 5)=\frac{3}{11}
\]
and 
\[
P(\text{€} 5 \cap \text{€} 5) = P(\text{€} 5) \cdot P(\text{€}) 5 | \text{€} 5) = \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{3}{11}=\frac{1}{11}.
\]
The probability of drawing a € 5 bill and then another € 5 bill is $\frac{1}{11}$.

To die or not to die

You read on Facebook that in the year 2021 about over 80\% of people that died were vaccinated. You are shocked by this high probability that a dead person was vaccinated, $P(V|D)$. You decide to check this fact. Reading the study to which the Facebook post is referring, you find out that the study only refers to people above the age of 90. Moreover, you find the following _Tree Diargram_. It allows checking the fact as it describes the vaccination rates and the conditional probabilities of people to die given the fact they were vaccinated or not.
In particular, $D$ denotes the event of _die_ and $\neg D$ denotes _not die_, i.e., survive; $V$ denotes the event of _vaccinated_ and $\neg V$ _not vaccinated_.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.11</span> Cognitive biases in decision making<a href="decision-making-basics.html#cognitive-biases" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In section <a href="decision-making-basics.html#bounded-rationality">2.7</a>, we discussed how human beings have limited cognitive abilities to arrive at optimal solutions. Behavioral economics, pioneered by Amos Tversky (1937-1996) and 2002 Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahnemann (*1934), has identified several biases that explain why and when people fail to act perfectly rationally. In the following sections, we will explore some of the most prominent biases that arise from humans relying on heuristics in decision-making. Specifically, we will describe biases result from the use of availability, representative, and confirmation heuristics and can lead to flawed decision-making and negative outcomes for individuals and organizations. By recognizing and accounting for these biases, we can make better decisions.</p>
<div id="availability-heuristic" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.11.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.11.1</span> Availability heuristic<a href="decision-making-basics.html#availability-heuristic" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>availability heuristic</strong> refers to our tendency to make judgments or decisions based on information that is easily retrievable from memory. For example, if someone hears a lot of news about a particular stock or investment, they may be more likely to invest in it, even if there are other better investment options available. This bias can also lead individuals to overestimate the frequency of certain events, such as the likelihood of a market crash, based on recent media coverage.</p>
</div>
<div id="representative-heuristic" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.11.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.11.2</span> Representative heuristic<a href="decision-making-basics.html#representative-heuristic" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>representative heuristic</strong> refers to our tendency to make judgments based on how similar something is to a stereotype or preconceived notion. For example, an investor might assume that a company with a flashy website and marketing materials is more successful than a company with a more low-key image, even if the latter is actually more profitable. This bias can also lead to assumptions about the performance of certain investment strategies based on their resemblance to other successful strategies.</p>
</div>
<div id="confirmation-heuristic" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.11.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.11.3</span> Confirmation heuristic<a href="decision-making-basics.html#confirmation-heuristic" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The <strong>confirmation heuristic</strong> refers to our tendency to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. For example, an investor who strongly believes in the potential of a particular investment might only read news and analysis that supports their belief and ignore any information that suggests otherwise. This can lead to a failure to consider potential risks and downsides of an investment.</p>

<p>You are financially literate if you understand and manage personal finances effectively. It involves having a basic understanding of financial concepts, such as budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt. Financial literacy also includes knowledge of financial products and services, such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and insurance.
Being financially literate means having the skills and knowledge to make informed financial decisions, and being able to assess risks and opportunities when it comes to managing money. It is an important life skill that can help individuals achieve their financial goals, build wealth, and avoid financial pitfalls.</p>
<p>Being better-educated was always associated with having more financial knowledge (Figure
1) across the countries we examined,3 yet we also found that education is not enough. That
is, even well-educated people are not necessarily savvy about money.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, financial illiteracy is widespread. While being better-educated is associated with making better financial decisions on average, “even well-educated people are not necessarily savvy about money” <span class="citation">(<a href="solutions-to-exercises.html#ref-Mitchell2015Financial">Mitchell &amp; Lusardi, 2015, p. 3</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There are various attempts to assess the levels of financial literacy. See <a href="https://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-education/measuringfinancialliteracy.htm" class="uri">https://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-education/measuringfinancialliteracy.htm</a> for example.</p>

<p>If the annual interest, <span class="math inline">\(P(1+r)\)</span>, is added to <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, we need a formula that takes this into account, and for two periods this is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

\]</span></p>
<p>and for t periods</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on principal plus interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, or adding it to the loaned capital rather than paying it out, or requiring payment from borrower, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest.</p>

<p>Suppose a principal amount of $1,500 is deposited in a bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded quarterly. Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with <span class="math inline">\(P = 1500\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r = 0.043\)</span> (4.3%), <span class="math inline">\(n = 4\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t = 6\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
A=1500\times\left(1+\frac{0.043}{4}\right)^{4\times 6}\approx 1938.84

<p>So the amount <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> after 6 years is approximately $1,938.84.</p>

<p>The present is the value of an expected income stream determined as of the date of valuation. The present value is usually less than the future value because money has interest-earning potential, a characteristic referred to as the time value of money, except during times of zero- or negative interest rates, when the present value will be equal or more than the future value. Time value can be described with the simplified phrase, ``A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow’‘. Here, ’worth more’ means that its value is greater than tomorrow. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because the dollar can be invested and earn a day’s worth of interest, making the total accumulate to a value more than a dollar by tomorrow.</p>

<p>When making decisions about financial products such as investments or loans, it is important to consider their long-term impact on your finances. <em>Net Present Value</em> (NPV) and <em>Internal Rate of Return</em> (IRR) are two key indicators that can help guide decision making and determine whether a financial product is a good investment.</p>
<p>Net Present Value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of all cash inflows and the present value of all cash outflows over a given time period. The formula to calculate NPV is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ NPV = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n} - C_0 \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(C_n\)</span> denotes net cash inflow during the period <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> the discount rate, or the cost of capital, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> the number of periods, and <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span> the initial investment.</p>
<p>In other words, NPV helps determine the current value of future cash flows, adjusted for the time value of money. A positive NPV indicates that an investment is expected to generate a return greater than the cost of capital, while a negative NPV suggests that the investment is likely to result in a loss.</p>
<p>Internal Rate of Return (IRR), on the other hand, is the discount rate that makes the NPV of all cash inflows equal to the NPV of all cash outflows. The formula to calculate IRR is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 0 = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{C_n}{(1+IRR)^n}  \]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(C_n\)</span> denotes the net cash inflow during the period <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(IRR\)</span> the internal rate of return, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> the number of periods, and <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span> the initial investment.</p>
<p>IRR can be thought of as the rate of return an investment generates over time, taking into account the time value of money. When comparing different investment opportunities, a higher IRR generally indicates a more profitable investment.</p>
<p>Both NPV and IRR are important tools to help individuals make informed decisions about financial products. By comparing the NPV and IRR of different investment options, individuals can determine which investments are likely to generate the greatest returns over time, and which products may not be worth the initial investment.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while NPV and IRR are useful indicators for decision making, they are not the only factors to consider. Individuals should also consider other important factors such as risk, liquidity, and diversification when evaluating different financial products. By taking a holistic approach and considering all relevant factors, individuals can make informed decisions that are best suited to their financial goals and circumstances.</p>

<p>Most data are recorded for discrete periods of time (e.g., quarters, years). Consequently, it is often useful to model economic dynamics in discrete periods of time. A good linear approximation to a growth rate from time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t=1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\ln x_0 - \ln x_1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{x_1 - x_0}{x_0} \approx \ln x_1 - \ln x_0
\]</span></p>
<p>Let us prove that with some numbers of per capita real GDP for the US and Japan in 1950 and 1989:</p>
<p>What are the annual average growth rates over this period for the US and Japan? Here is one way to answer this question:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_{1989} = (1 + g)^{39} \cdot Y_{1950}
\]</span></p>
<p>Consequently, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> can be calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(1 + g) = \left(\frac{Y_{1989}}{Y_{1950}}\right)^{\frac{1}{39}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Yielding <span class="math inline">\(g = 0.0195\)</span> for the US and <span class="math inline">\(g = 0.0597\)</span> for Japan. The US grew at an average growth rate of about 2% annually over the period, while Japan grew at about 6% annually.</p>
<p>The following method gives a close approximation to the answer above and will be useful in other contexts. A useful approximation is that for any small number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\ln (1 + x) \approx x\)</span></p>
<p>Now, we can take the natural log of both sides of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{Y_{1989}}{Y_{1950}} = (1 + g)^{39}
\]</span></p>
<p>to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\ln (Y_{1989}) - \ln (Y_{1950}) = 39 \cdot \ln (1 + g)
\]</span></p>
<p>which rearranges to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\ln (1 + g) = \frac{\ln (Y_{1989}) - \ln (Y_{1950})}{39}
\]</span></p>
<p>and using our approximation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
g \approx \frac{\ln (Y_{1989}) - \ln (Y_{1950})}{39}
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, log growth rates are good approximations for percentage growth rates. Calculating log growth rates for the data above, we get <span class="math inline">\(g \approx 0.0194\)</span> for the US and <span class="math inline">\(g \approx 0.0582\)</span> for Japan. The approximation is close for both.</p>

<h4>Plotting growth using the logarithm<a href="decision-making-basics.html#plotting-growth-using-the-logarithm" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Recall that, with a constant growth rate <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and starting from time 0, output in time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_t = (1 + g)^t \cdot Y_0\]</span></p>
<p>Taking natural logs of both sides, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\ln Y_t = \ln Y_0 + t \cdot \ln (1 + g)\]</span></p>
<p>We see that log output is linear in time. Thus, if the growth rate is constant, a plot of log output against time will yield a straight line. Consequently, plotting log output against time is a quick way to <strong>eyeball</strong> whether growth rates have changed over time.</p>
