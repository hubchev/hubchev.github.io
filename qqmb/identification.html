<p>In empirical research, <em>identification refers to the process of establishing a clear and logical relationship between a cause and an effect</em>. This involves demonstrating that the cause is responsible for the observed effect, and that there are no other factors that could potentially explain the effect.
The goal of identification is to provide strong evidence that a particular factor is indeed the cause of a particular outcome, rather than simply coincidentally happen.
In order to identify a cause-and-effect relationship, researchers can use experimental or non-experimental, i.e., observational data, or both. The next section discusses how to generate or collect this data.</p>
<div id="how-to-get-data" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> How to get data<a href="identification.html#how-to-get-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>There are several ways to get data which allows you to identify a cause-and-effect relationship:</p>
<div id="interviews" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Interviews<a href="identification.html#interviews" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<p class="caption">Figure 2.1:  Interview<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>An interview is normally a one-on-one verbal conversation. Interviews are conducted to learn about the participants’ experiences, perceptions, opinions, or motivations. The relationship between the interviewer and interviewee must be taken into account and other circumstances (place, time, face to face, email, etc.) should be taken into account.
There are three types of interviews structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.
<em>Structured interviews</em> use a set list of questions and hence are like a verbal surveys. In <em>unstructured interviews</em> the interviewer doesn’t use predetermined questions but only a list of topics to address. Semi-structured interviews are the middle ground. Semi-structured interviews require the interviewer to have a list of questions and topics pre-prepared, which can be asked in different ways with different interviewee/s. Semi-structured interviews increase the flexibility and the responsiveness of the interview while keeping the interview on track, increasing the reliability and credibility of the data. Semi-structured interviews are one of the most common interview techniques.</p>
<p>Structured interviews use a predetermined list of questions that must be asked in a specific order, improving the validity and trustworthiness of the data but lowering respondent response. Structured interviews resemble verbal questionnaires.
In unstructured interviews, the interviewer has a planned list of subjects to cover but no predetermined interview questions. In exchange for less reliable data, this makes the interview more adaptable. Long-term field observation studies may employ unstructured interviews.
The middle ground are interviews that are semi-structured. In semi-structured interviews, the interviewer must prepare a list of questions and themes that can be brought up in various ways with various interviewees.</p>
<p>Interviews allow you to address a cause-and-effect relationship fairly directly, and it can be a good idea to interview experts and ask some <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> questions to gather initial knowledge about a particular topic before further elaborating your research strategy. For example, I interviewed kindergarten teachers with many years of experience working with children, as well as other parents, to get information on how to solve the problem of my children throwing plates around the dining room.
However, findings based on interviews are not very valid or reliable because the personal perceptions of both the interviewer and the interviewee can have an impact on the conclusions drawn. For example, I received very different tips and explanations because of the personal experiences of the people I interviewed. Unfortunately, I could not really ask my son why he was misbehaving. His vocabulary was too limited at the time, and even if he could speak, he would probably refuse to tell me the truth.</p>

<div id="surveys" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.2">

</div>
<p>In contrast to an interview a survey can be sent out to many different people. Surveys can be used to identify a cause-and-effect relationship by asking questions about both the cause and the effect and examining the responses. For example, if a researcher wanted to determine whether there is a relationship between a person’s level of education and their income, they could conduct a survey asking participants about their education level and their income. If the data shows that participants with higher levels of education tend to have higher incomes, it suggests that education may be a cause of higher income. However, it is important to note that surveys can only establish a correlation between variables, but it is difficult to claim that correlations that where found through the survey imply a causal relationship. To establish a causal relationship, a researcher would need to use other methods, such as an experiment, to control for other potential factors that might influence the relationship that the respondent does not see.</p>

</div>
<p>Case studies involve in-depth examination of a single case or a small number of cases in order to understand a particular phenomenon. Case studies can be conducted using both quantitative and qualitative methods, depending on the research question and the data being analyzed. While it is reasonable to find causal effects in the particular case, it is problematic to generalize the causal relationship. To establish a general causal relationship, a researcher would need to use other methods, such as an experiment, to control for other potential factors that might influence the relationship that the respondent does not see.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> Experiments<a href="identification.html#experiments" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>One way to clearly identify a cause-and-effect relationship is through experiments, which involve manipulating the cause (the independent variable) and measuring the effect (the dependent variable) under controlled conditions (we will later on define precisely what is meant here). Experiments can be conducted using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A medical study in which a new drug is tested on a group of patients, while a control group receives a placebo.</li>
<li>An educational study in which a group of students is taught a new method of learning, while a control group is taught using the traditional method.</li>
<li>An agricultural study in which a group of crops is treated with a new fertilization method, while a control group is not treated.</li>
<li>A study to determine the effect of a new training program on employee productivity might involve randomly assigning employees to either a control group that does not receive the training, or an experimental group that does receive the training. By comparing the productivity of the two groups, the researchers can determine if the new training program had a causal effect on employee productivity.</li>
<li>A study to determine the effect of a new advertising campaign on sales might involve randomly assigning different groups of customers to be exposed to different versions of the campaign. By comparing the sales of the different groups, the researchers can determine if the advertising campaign had a causal effect on sales.</li>
<li>In <em>experimental economics</em>, experimental methods are used to study economic questions. In a lab-like environment data are collected to investigate the size of certain effects, to test the validity of economic theories, to illuminate market mechanisms, or to examine the decision making of people. Economic experiments usually motivates and rewards subjects with money. The overall goal is to mimic real-world incentives and investigate things that cannot be captured or identified in the field.</li>
<li>In <em>behavioral economics</em>, laboratory experiments are also used to study decisions of individuals or institutions and to test economic theory. However, it is done with a focus on cognitive, psychological, emotional, cultural, and social factors.</li>

<p>The strength of evidence from a controlled experiment is generally considered to be strong. However, the external validity, i.e., the generalizability, should be considered as well. External validity is sometimes low because effects that you can identify and measure in a lab are sometimes only of minor importance in the field.</p>
<p>There are different types of experiments:</p>
<p><strong>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)</strong> are a specific type of an experiment that involve randomly assigning participants to different treatment groups and comparing the outcomes of those groups. RCTs are often considered the gold standard of experimental research because they provide a high degree of control over extraneous variables and are less prone to bias.</p>
<p>For a better explanation and some great insights into what an RCT actually is, please watch the video produced by UNICEFInnocenti and published on the YouTube channel of UNICEF’s dedicated research center <a href="https://youtu.be/Wy7qpJeozec" class="uri">https://youtu.be/Wy7qpJeozec</a></p>

</div>
<p><strong>Quasi-experiments</strong> involve the manipulation of an independent variable, but do not involve random assignment of participants to treatment groups. Quasi-experiments are less controlled than RCTs, but can still provide valuable insights into cause-and-effect relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Natural experiments</strong> involve the observation of naturally occurring events or situations that provide an opportunity to study cause-and-effect relationships. Natural experiments are often used when it is not possible or ethical to manipulate variables experimentally.</p>
<p>In a <strong>laboratory experiment</strong>, researchers manipulate an independent variable and measure the effect on a dependent variable in a controlled laboratory setting. This allows for greater control over extraneous variables, but the results may not generalize to real-world situations.</p>
<p>In a <strong>field experiment</strong>, researchers manipulate an independent variable and measure the effect on a dependent variable in a natural setting, rather than in a laboratory.

</div>
<p>Observational data are data that had been observed before the research question was asked or being collected independently from the study.
To understand how observational data can be used to constitute a causal relationship is a bit tricky because there is only one world and only one reality at a time. In other words, we usually miss a counterfactual which we can use for a comparison. Take, for example, the past COVID-19 pandemic, where you chose to be vaccinated or not. Regardless of what you chose, we will never find out what would have happened to you if you had chosen differently. Maybe you would have died, maybe you would have gotten more or less sick, or maybe you wouldn’t have gotten sick at all. We don’t know, and it’s impossible to find out because it’s impossible to observe the counterfactual outcomes. This makes it difficult to establish causality from observational data. However, ingenious minds have found reasonable procedures and methods to extract some level of knowledge from observational data that allows us to infer causal relationships from observational data where we cannot directly observe the counterfactual outcome. We will come back to these methods later on.</p>
<p>In the upcoming sections, however, we will discuss experimental research designs including <em>randomized controlled trials</em> (RCTs) which are considered to be the “gold standard for measuring the effect of an action” <span class="citation">(Taddy 2019, 128)</span>. RCTs can be used, for example, to study the effectiveness of drugs by observing people randomly assigned to three groups, one taking the pill (or treatment), a second receiving a placebo, and a third taking nothing. If the first group responds in any way differently than the other groups, the drug has an effect. Before explaining an RCT in more detail, we need to be clear about the fundamental problem of causal inference. This will be discussed in the following.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Correlation does not imply causation<a href="identification.html#correlation-does-not-imply-causation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables, where one variable tends to increase or decrease as the other variable also increases or decreases. However, just because two variables are correlated does not necessarily mean that one variable causes the other. This is known as the <em>correlation does not imply causation</em> principle.</p>
<p>For example, it may be observed that the number of storks in a particular area is correlated with the birth rate of babies in that area. However, this does not mean that the presence of storks causes an increase in the birth rate. It is possible that both the number of storks and the number of babies born are influenced by other factors, such as the overall population density or economic conditions in the area.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to carefully consider all possible explanations (confounders) for a correlation and to use empirical evidence to determine the true cause-and-effect relationship between variables.</p>

<p>As <span class="citation">Cunningham (2021)</span> explains in his book, it is very hard to claim causality. In the following section, I will paraphrase briefly two aspects why it is so difficult to claim to have found a causal effect. It is difficult to know how to use data properly and how to find or generate the right data. Therefore, I will discuss Simpson’s Paradox and the that gives an idea how difficult it is to analyze observational data meaningful and that we need to have a theory when looking on data and we should try to challenge the assumptions on which out theory is build on. After that I will briefly discuss</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Some common misconceptions about causality that the author addresses in chapter 1 include confusion between correlation and causality, and the belief that observational studies cannot (hardly) establish causality without prior knowledge. He says that human beings “engaging in optimal behavior are the main reason correlations almost never reveal causal relationships, because rarely are human beings acting randomly” which is crucial for identifying causal effects.</p></li>
<li><p>The role of randomization in causal inference, as described in the book, is that it helps to control for confounding variables and allows for the estimation of causal effects.</p></li>

<p>Discrimination is bad. Whenever we see it, we should try to find ways to overcome it. De jure segregation mandated the separation of races by law is clearly discriminatory. Other forms of discrimination, however, are often more difficult to spot and as long we don’t have good evidence for discrimination, we should not judge prematurely. That means we should be sure that we see an act of making unjustified distinctions between individuals based on some categories to which they belong or perceived to belong. For example, if men and women are treated differently without an acceptable reason, we consider it discriminative. For example, UC Berkeley was accused of discrimination in 1973 because it admitted only 35% of female applicants but 44% of male applicants overall. The difference was statistical significant. However, it turned out that the selection of students was not discriminative against women but agains men accordingly to <span class="citation">Bickel, Hammel, and O’Connell (1975)</span>. Who conclude there was just a “tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter” <span class="citation">(Bickel, Hammel, and O’Connell 1975, 403)</span>. Figure <a href="identification.html#fig:berkley">2.10</a> taken from <span class="citation">Bickel, Hammel, and O’Connell (1975, 403)</span> visualizes this fact.</p>

<p>Here you can read the summary of their infamous study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Examination of aggregate data on graduate admissions to the University of California, Berkeley, for fall 1973 shows a clear but misleading pattern of bias against female applicants. Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few decision-making units that show statistically significant departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and about as many units appear to favor women as to favor men. If the data are properly pooled, taking into account the autonomy of departmental decision making, thus correcting for the tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter, there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. The graduate departments that are easier to enter tend to be those that require more mathematics in the undergraduate preparatory curriculum. The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, which seem quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system. Women are shunted by their socialization and education toward fields of graduate study that are generally more crowded, less productive of completed degrees, and less well funded, and that frequently offer poorer professional employment prospects.”</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Assumption 1 is that in any given discipline male and female applicants do not differ in respect of their intelligence, skill, qualifications, promise, or other attribute deemed legitimately pertinent to their acceptance as students. It is precisely this assumption that makes the study of “sex bias” meaningful, for if we did not hold it any differences in acceptance of applicants by sex could be attributed to differences in their qualifications, promise as scholars, and so on. (…) Assumption 2 is that the sex ratios of applicants to the various fields of graduate study are not importantly associated with any other factors in admission.” <span class="citation">(Bickel, Hammel, and O’Connell 1975, 398)</span></li>
<li>Expectations were taken based on the overall acceptance rate of about 0.416 and multiplied by the total observed numbers of applicants admitted and rejected. For example: <span class="math inline">\((3738+4704) \cdot 0.41666 \approx 3460\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((3738+4704) \cdot (1-0.41666) \approx 4981\)</span>. Taking the difference of these two measures gives the number to be explained.</li>
<li>The analogy is explained on page 400: “Picture a fishnet with two different mesh sizes. A school of fish, all of identical size (assumption 1), swim toward the net and seek to pass. The female fish all try to get through the small mesh, while the male fish all try to get through the large mesh. On the other side of the net all the fish are male. Assumption 2 said that the sex of the fish had no relation to the size of the mesh they tried to get through. It is false.”</li>
</ol>
<p>The UC Berkley case is just one of many examples to illustrate that uniformity of group assignment of individuals is a necessary condition to ensure that pooling of data does not lead to misleading conclusions when using statistics. The phenomenon of obtaining different results depending on whether one considers the data pooled or unpooled is often referred to as the <em>Simpson paradox</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="citation">Keele (2015, 314)</span>: <em>“An identification analysis identifies the assumptions needed for statistical estimates to be given a causal interpretation.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we are interested in the causal effect of a certain treatment on an outcome, we need to compare the outcome of the individuals who received the treatment to the outcome of the individuals who did not receive the treatment. However, if the counterfactual outcome is missing for some individuals, we cannot make this comparison and therefore cannot estimate the causal effect. Unfortunately, the counterfactual is very often missing. For example, if we want to measure the effect of a vaccine we never can have a person who is vaccinated and not vaccinated at the same time.</p>
<p>The Rubin Causal Model, also known as the potential outcomes framework, is a statistical framework for analyzing causality in the context of missing data. It goes back to Donald B. Rubin (*1943) a statistician and is now a widely used method for causal inference. The basic premise of the Rubin Causal Model is that for each individual in a study, there are two potential outcomes: the outcome that would occur if the individual were exposed to a certain treatment or intervention (the “treatment group”), and the outcome that would occur if the individual were not exposed to that treatment (the “control group”). The key idea is that these potential outcomes can be used to infer causality by comparing the outcomes between the treatment and control groups even if we do not have a full set of data.</p>

<p>Given the some assumptions, the Rubin Causal Model allows for estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE) - the difference in the expected outcomes between the treatment and control groups. There are several ways to estimate the ATE under the Rubin Causal Model some of which will be part of this course. Applied correctly, it can provide valuable insights into causality and inform decision making. However, the Rubin Causal Model has its limitations and assumptions that need to be met in order for the inferences to be valid.</p>

<li>Can the ATE be used to determine the effect of a treatment on an individual level?</li>
<li>What are some potential sources of bias when estimating the ATE?</li>
</ol>
<p>Answers:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The individual treatment effect (ITE) is a measure of the effect of a treatment or intervention on an individual level. It represents the difference in the outcome for an individual who receives the treatment versus the outcome for that same individual if they had not received the treatment.</li>
<li>The average treatment effect (ATE) is a measure of the difference in the expected outcomes between a treatment group and a control group. It represents the overall effect of a treatment on the population as a whole.</li>
<li>The ATE is calculated by taking the difference between the average outcome for the treatment group and the average outcome for the control group.</li>
<li>No, the ATE is a population-level measure and cannot be used to determine the effect of a treatment on an individual level. To determine the effect of a treatment on an individual level, you would need to use techniques such as propensity score matching or instrumental variables.</li>
<li>Some potential sources of bias when estimating the ATE include selection bias, measurement bias, and unobserved confounding variables. To mitigate these biases, researchers may use randomization or other advanced statistical techniques such as propensity score matching or instrumental variables to control for these potential sources of bias.</li>
